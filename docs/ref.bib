abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Injuries remain a leading cause of death in the developing world. Whereas new investments are welcome, quality improvement (QI) at the currently available trauma care facilities is essential. The objective of this study was to determine the effect and long-term sustainability of trauma QI initiatives on in-hospital mortality and complications at a large tertiary hospital in a developing country.
METHODS:In 2002, a specialized trauma team was formed (members trained using advanced trauma life support), and a western style trauma program established including a registry and quality assurance program. Patients from 1998 onward were entered in to this registry, enabling a preimplementation and postimplementation study. Adults (>15 years) with blunt or penetrating trauma were analyzed. The main outcomes of interest were (1) in-hospital mortality and (2) occurrence of any complication. Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the impact of formalized trauma care on outcomes, controlling for covariates reaching significance in the bivariate analyses.

RESULTS:A total of 1,227 patient records were analyzed. Patient demographics and injury characteristics are described in Table 1. Overall in-hospital mortality rate was 6.4\%, and the complication rate was 11.1\%. On multivariate analysis, patients admitted during the trauma service years were 4.9 times less likely to die (95\% confidence interval, 1.77-13.57) and 2.60 times (odds ratio; 95\% confidence interval, 1.29-5.21) less likely to have a complication compared with those treated in the pretrauma service years.

CONCLUSION:Despite significant delays in hospital transit and lack of prehospital trauma care, hospital level implementation of trauma QI program greatly decreases mortality and complication rates in the developing world.

abstract = {{Background: SARS-CoV-2 may pose an occupational health risk to health care workers, but the prevalence of infections in this population is unknown. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among health care workers at a large acute care hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. We determined correlations between seroprevalence, self-reported symptoms and occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings: All employees at Danderyd Hospital (n=4375) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. 2149 employees from all hospital departments were enrolled in the study between April 14th and May 8th 2020. Study participants completed a questionnaire consisting of symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection since January 2020 and occupational exposure to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using a multiplex assay evaluated to have 99.4\% sensitivity and 99.1\% specificity. The over-all seroprevalence among 2149 participants was 19.1\% (n=410). There was no difference in age or sex between seropositive and seronegative participants. The symptoms with the strongest correlation to seroprevalence were anosmia and ageusia, with odds ratios of 28.4 (p=2.02*10\textasciicircum-120) and 19.2 (p=1.67*10\textasciicircum-99) respectively. Seroprevalence was strongly associated with patient-related work (OR 2.9, p=4.24*10\textasciicircum-8), covid-19 patient contact (OR 1.43, p=0.003), and occupation as assisting nurse (OR 3.67, p=2.16*10\textasciicircum-9). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that anosmia and ageusia should be included in screening guidance and in the recommendations of self-isolation to reduce further spread of SARS-CoV-2. The results furthermore imply an occupational health risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital workers. Continued measures are warranted to assure healthcare worker safety and reduce transmission from health care settings to the community during the covid-19 outbreak.}},

abstract = {{Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel enveloped single stranded RNA coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an ongoing global pandemic. While other countries deployed widespread testing as an early mitigation strategy, the U.S. experienced delays in development and deployment of organism identification assays. As such, there is uncertainty surrounding disease burden and community spread, severely hampering containment efforts. COVID-19 illuminates the need for a tiered diagnostic approach to rapidly identify clinically significant infections and reduce disease spread. Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies. A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients. Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity. Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.}},

journal = {Psychological review},

abstract = {{The neurobiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD) remains unclear. Dysfunctions of several neurobiological systems, including serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and other neurotransmitter systems, have been discussed. Here we present a theory that alterations in the sensitivity of opioid receptors or the availability of endogenous opioids constitute part of the underlying pathophysiology of BPD. The alarming symptoms and self-destructive behaviors of the affected patients may be explained by uncontrollable and unconscious attempts to stimulate their endogenous opioid system (EOS) and the dopaminergic reward system, regardless of the possible harmful consequences. Neurobiological findings that support this hypothesis are reviewed: Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, frequent and risky sexual contacts, and attention-seeking behavior may be explained by attempts to make use of the rewarding effects of human attachment mediated by the EOS. Anhedonia and feelings of emptiness may be an expression of reduced activity of the EOS. Patients with BPD tend to abuse substances that target mu-opioid receptors. Self-injury, food restriction, aggressive behavior, and sensation seeking may be interpreted as desperate attempts to artificially set the body to survival mode in order to mobilize the last reserves of the EOS. BPD-associated symptoms, such as substance abuse, anorexia, self-injury, depersonalization, and sexual overstimulation, can be treated successfully with opioid receptor antagonists. An understanding of the neurobiology of BPD may help in developing new treatments for patients with this severe disorder.}},

abstract = {{ Background Prospective predictors of trauma-related outcomes have been validated to guide management in low-resource settings. The primary objective of this study was to determine the optimal prospective prediction method for mortality within combat and humanitarian trauma. Materials and methods Retrospective review of the Department of Defense Trauma Registry from 2008 to 2016 was performed for adult patients. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were calculated to assess the predictability of shock index (SI), reverse SI × Glasgow Coma Scale (rSIG), SI × Glasgow Coma Scale (SIG), Revised Trauma Score, and Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) on mortality at point of injury, arrival in emergency department (ED), and the difference in vital signs between those time points. Results A total of 22,218 patients were included. Overall, 97.1\% were male, median age range 25-29 y, Injury Severity Score 9.4 ± 0.07, with predominantly penetrating injuries (58.1\%), and mortality of 3.4\%. ED vitals yielded higher predictability of mortality for all tests based on higher AUROCs. TRISS and rSIG demonstrated the highest AUROCs (0.955 and 0.923, respectively). The optimal cutoff value for rSIG was 14.1 (sensitivity 89\% and specificity 87\%). rSIG values <14.1 were significantly associated with mortality (P < 0.01; odds ratio = 5.901). Conclusions Initial ED vital signs represented a better predictor of early mortality compared with point of injury vital signs for all predictive tools assessed. TRISS and rSIG proved to be most predictive of mortality. However, of the prospective tools assessed, rSIG may be optimal scoring tool because of its ease of calculation and its increased ability to predict mortality.}},

abstract = {{Background About 5.8 million people die each year as a result of injuries, and nearly 90\% of these deaths occur in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Trauma scoring is a cornerstone of trauma quality improvement (QI) efforts, and is key to organizing and evaluating trauma services. The objective of this review was to assess the appropriateness, feasibility, and QI applicability of traditional trauma scoring systems in LMIC settings. Materials and methods This systematic review searched PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and trauma-focused journals for articles describing the use of a standardized trauma scoring system to characterize holistic health status. Studies conducted in high-income countries (HIC) or describing scores for isolated anatomic locations were excluded. Data reporting a score’s capacity to discriminate mortality, feasibility of implementation, or use for QI were extracted and synthesized. Results Of the 896 articles screened, 336 were included. Over half of studies (56\%) reported Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by Injury Severity Score (ISS; 51\%), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS; 24\%), Revised Trauma Score (RTS; 19\%), Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS; 14\%), and Kampala Trauma Score (7\%). While ISS was overwhelmingly predictive of mortality, 12 articles reported limited feasibility of ISS and/or AIS. RTS consistently underestimated injury severity. Over a third of articles (37\%) reporting TRISS assessmentsobserved mortality that was greater than that predicted by TRISS. Several articles cited limited human resources as the key challenge to feasibility. Conclusions The findings of this review reveal that implementing systems designed for HICs may not be relevant to the burden and resources available in LMICs. Adaptations or alternative scoring systems may be more effective. PROSPERO registration number CRD42017064600.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to effectuate a consensus of emergency physicians on minimum requirements for facility, diagnostic, and medical specialist availability as a first step toward minimum operational standards for 24/7 available emergency departments (EDs) in the Netherlands.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:A two-part e-Delphi through online survey was performed between January 2015 and May 2016, using a panel of 20 experts in emergency medicine. The aim of part I was to reach an agreement on a list of possible ED elements and their definitions. The second part addressed the actual study objective to reach consensus on operational standards. Successive rounds were submitted to the members of the panel online using SurveyMonkey. Results of each survey round were discussed and interpreted in agreement with all authors in preparation for the next round. Reaching consensus, defined as 70\% or more agreement or disagreement among the panel, on the level of all items was the endpoint of this study.

RESULTS:Both parts I and II required five rounds. The dropout rate of the expert panel remained zero. The availability of 52 facilities and diagnostic functionalities and the manner in which 17 medical specialties should be available to every 24/7 ED were agreed upon by the expert panel.

CONCLUSION:An expert panel agreed upon minimum operational standards for EDs in the Netherlands. These results are helpful as a first step toward a more widely supported standard for future 24/7 available EDs in the Netherlands and in addition to this other urgent care facilities.}},

journal = {Emergency medicine journal : EMJ},
doi = {10.1136/emj.2003.004895},
abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:To describe the development of emergency medicine (EM) in Israel and review the specific problems faced by the discipline and describe the solutions that were found.
METHODS:A comprehensive literature search was conducted for data on development of EM in the UK and in North America, and the personal knowledge of two of the authors (PH and YW) was used in preparing the article.

RESULTS:There are differences in development of EM between Israel and the UK/US models. In Israel the specialty developed within the context of established high quality clinical practice and consequently it met resistance from the system, which did not wish to invest in what it felt might be marginal improvements in patient care. The economics of Israeli medicine also dictated that EM be made into a super-specialty rather than a primary specialty. Certified specialists from family medicine, paediatrics, internal medicine, general surgery, anaesthesia, and orthopaedic surgery can access training positions in EM. Currently there are seven active EM programmes of 2.5 years duration and 16 residents. The curriculum is flexible and a national certification examination is being developed.

CONCLUSIONS:Development of EM can and should take different paths according to the specific local needs and realities. There is no single ideal model suitable for all circumstances. The practice of clinical EM in Israel is comparable with that of any developed country and daily progress is being made in the academic areas of teaching and research. There are worldwide similarities in the process of developing EM as a distinct discipline.}},

abstract = {{Background In an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries. Methods GBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories. Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources. Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates. Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs. A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes. Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs. We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution. Findings Global health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates. After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable. Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group. Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth). In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth). Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth). In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups. Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries. In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden. Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI. Interpretation As disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies. With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes. The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The TraumaRegister DGU® (TR-DGU) of the German Trauma Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie, DGU) enables the participating hospitals to perform quality management. For that purpose, nine so-called audit filters have existed, since its foundation, which, inter alia, is listed in the Annual Report. The objective of this study effort is a revision of these quality indicators with the aim of developing pertinent new and reliable quality indicators for the management of severely injured patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:Apart from indicators already used at national and international levels, a systematic review of the literature revealed further potential key figures for quality of the management of severely injured patients. The latter were evaluated by an interdisciplinary and interprofessional group of experts using a standardized QUALIFY process to assess their suitability as a quality indicator.

RESULTS:By means of the review of the literature, 39 potential indicators could be identified. 9 and 14 indicators, respectively, were identified in existing trauma registries (TR-DGU and TARN), 17 in the ATLS® training concept, and 57 in the S3 guideline on the treatment of polytrauma/severe injuries. The exclusion of duplicates and the limitation to indicators that can be collected using the TR-DGU Version 2015 data set resulted in a total of 43 indicators to be reviewed. For each of the 43 indicators, 13 quality criteria were assessed. A consensus was achieved in 305 out of 559 individual assessments. With 13 quality criteria assessed and 43 indicators correspond this to a relative consensus value of 54.6\%. None of the indicators achieved a consensus in all 13 quality criteria assessed. The following 13 indicators achieved a consensus in at least 9 quality criteria: time between hospital admission and WBCT, mortality, administration of tranexamic acid to bleeding patients, use of CCT with GCS > 14, time until first emergency surgical intervention (7-item list in the TR-DGU), time until surgical intervention for penetrating trauma, application of pelvic sling belt (prehospital), capnometry (etCO2) in intubated patients, time until CCT with GCS < 15, time until surgery for hemorrhagic shock, time until craniotomy for severe TBI, prehospital airway management in unconscious patients (GCS < 9), and complete basic diagnostics available. Two indicators achieved a consensus in 11 criteria and thus represent the maximum consensus achieved within the group of experts. Four indicators only achieved a consensus in three quality criteria. 17 indicators had a mean value for the 3 relevance criteria of ≥ 3.5 and were, therefore, assessed by the group of experts as being highly relevant.

CONCLUSION:Not all the key figures published for the management of severely injured patients are suitable for use as quality indicators. It remains to be seen whether the quality indicators identified by experts using the QUALIFY process will meet the requirements in practice. Prior to the implementation of the assessed quality indicators in standardized quality assurance programs, a scientific evaluation based on national data will be required.}},

In most countries, the specialty of EM is either nonexistent or in an early stage of development. Many countries have recognized the need for, and value of, establishing a quality emergency health care system and are striving to create the specialty. These systems do not have to be high tech and expense but can focus on providing appropriate emergency training to physicians and other health care workers. Rather than repeatedly "reinventing the wheel" with the start of each new emergency care system, the preexisting knowledge base of EM can be shared with these countries. Since the United States has an advanced emergency health care system and the longest history of recognizing EM as a distinct medical specialty, lessons learned in the United States may benefit other countries. In order to provide appropriate advice to countries in the early phase of emergency health care development, careful assessment of national resources, governmental structure, population demographics, culture, and health care needs is necessary. This paper lists specific recommendations for EM organizations and physicians seeking to assist the development of the specialty of EM internationally.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Poor governance impedes the provision of equitable and cost-effective health care in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although systemic problems such as corruption and inefficiency have been characterized as intractable, "good governance" interventions that promote transparency, accountability and public participation have yielded encouraging results. Mobile phones and other Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are beginning to play a role in these interventions, but little is known about their use and effects in the context of LMIC health care.
METHODS:Multi-stage scoping review: Research questions and scope were refined through a landscape scan of relevant implementation activities and by analyzing related concepts in the literature. Relevant studies were identified through iterative Internet searches (Google, Google Scholar), a systematic search of academic databases (PubMed, Web of Science), social media crowdsourcing (targeted LinkedIn and Twitter appeals) and reading reference lists and websites of relevant organizations. Parallel expert interviews helped to verify concepts and emerging findings and identified additional studies for inclusion. Results were charted, analyzed thematically and summarized.

RESULTS:We identified 34 articles from a wide range of disciplines and sectors, including 17 published research articles and 17 grey literature reports. Analysis of these articles revealed 15 distinct ways of using ICTs for good governance activities in LMIC health care. These use cases clustered into four conceptual categories: 1) gathering and verifying information on services to improve transparency and auditability 2) aggregating and visualizing data to aid communication and decision making 3) mobilizing citizens in reporting poor practices to improve accountability and quality and 4) automating and auditing processes to prevent fraud. Despite a considerable amount of implementation activity, we identified little formal evaluative research.

CONCLUSION:Innovative digital approaches are increasingly being used to facilitate good governance in the health sectors of LMICs but evidence of their effectiveness is still limited. More empirical studies are needed to measure concrete impacts, document mechanisms of action, and elucidate the political and sociotechnical dynamics that make designing and implementing ICTs for good governance so complex. Many digital good governance interventions are driven by an assumption that transparency alone will effect change; however responsive feedback mechanisms are also likely to be necessary.}},

While many have made the case for improved injury prevention and trauma care, health system development in low- and middle-income countries is often limited by resources. This study aims to determine the economic benefit of improved injury prevention and trauma care in low- and middle-income countries. This study uses existing data on injury mortality worldwide from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate the number of lives that could be saved if injury mortality rates in low- and middle-income countries could be reduced to rates in high-income countries. Using economic modeling – through the human capital approach and the value of a statistical life approach – the study then demonstrates the associated economic benefit of these lives saved. 88 percent of injury-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. If injury mortality rates in low- and middle-income countries were reduced to rates in high-income countries, 2,117,500 lives could be saved per year. This would result in between 49 million and 52 million disability adjusted life years averted per year, with discounting and age weighting. Using the human capital approach, the associated economic benefit of reducing mortality rates ranges from \$245 to \$261 billion with discounting and age weighting. Using the value of a statistical life approach, the benefit is between 758 and 786 billion dollars per year. Reducing injury mortality in low- and middle-income countries could save over 2 million lives per year and provide significant economic benefit globally. Further investments in trauma care and injury prevention are needed.}},

Largely because of ibogaine's status as a Schedule I substance in the U.S., the development of ibogaine's use in the treatment of drug addiction took place outside conventional clinical and medical settings. This article reviews the history of ibogaine's use in the treatment of drug addiction, and discusses progress made towards, and obstacles blocking, the establishment of controlled clinical trials of ibogaine's efficacy. Preclinical research has generally supported anecdotal claims that ibogaine attenuates withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug cravings. Concerns about ibogaine's safety, as well as a dearth of solid data from human studies, have hampered progress in its development as an approved medication.

Prediction models that combine several features to estimate the risk of infection have been developed in hopes of assisting medical staff worldwide in triaging patients when allocating limited healthcare resources. Results: We established a machine learning approach that trained on records from 51,831 tested individuals (of whom 4,769 were confirmed COVID-19 cases) while the test set contained data from the following week (47,401 tested individuals of whom 3,624 were confirmed COVID-19 cases). Our model predicts COVID-19 test results with high accuracy using only eight features: gender, whether age is above 60, known contact with an infected individual, and five initial clinical symptoms. Summary: Overall, based on the nationwide data publicly reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, we developed a model that detects COVID-19 cases by simple features accessed by asking basic questions.

abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:Patients in ICUs are susceptible to subacute potentially catastrophic illnesses such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and hemorrhage that present as severe derangements of vital signs. More subtle physiologic signatures may be present before clinical deterioration, when treatment might be more effective. We performed multivariate statistical analyses of bedside physiologic monitoring data to identify such early subclinical signatures of incipient life-threatening illness.
DESIGN:We report a study of model development and validation of a retrospective observational cohort using resampling (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis type 1b internal validation) and a study of model validation using separate data (type 2b internal/external validation).

SETTING:University of Virginia Health System (Charlottesville), a tertiary-care, academic medical center.

PATIENTS:Critically ill patients consecutively admitted between January 2009 and June 2015 to either the neonatal, surgical/trauma/burn, or medical ICUs with available physiologic monitoring data.

INTERVENTIONS:None.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:We analyzed 146 patient-years of vital sign and electrocardiography waveform time series from the bedside monitors of 9,232 ICU admissions. Calculations from 30-minute windows of the physiologic monitoring data were made every 15 minutes. Clinicians identified 1,206 episodes of respiratory failure leading to urgent unplanned intubation, sepsis, or hemorrhage leading to multi-unit transfusions from systematic individual chart reviews. Multivariate models to predict events up to 24 hours prior had internally validated C-statistics of 0.61-0.88. In adults, physiologic signatures of respiratory failure and hemorrhage were distinct from each other but externally consistent across ICUs. Sepsis, on the other hand, demonstrated less distinct and inconsistent signatures. Physiologic signatures of all neonatal illnesses were similar.

CONCLUSIONS:Subacute potentially catastrophic illnesses in three diverse ICU populations have physiologic signatures that are detectable in the hours preceding clinical detection and intervention. Detection of such signatures can draw attention to patients at highest risk, potentially enabling earlier intervention and better outcomes.}},

This article reviews the overall health care system and medical climate in Korea, as well as the great progress made in establishing emergency medicine as a specialty. It also describes the many improvements implemented in academic emergency medicine, emergency patient care, and emergency medicine management systems. Although the current economic crisis offers new challenges, much optimism remains about the future of this new Korean specialty.}},

abstract = {{In this manuscript, I will outline three specific evolutionary achievements in the delivery of emergency and trauma care, followed by caveats on what prevents an emergency and trauma system from achieving optimal goals and maintaining them. First, I will review the emergence of the specialty of emergency medicine under the guidance of Dr. James Mills, and outline the steps he took to establish the specialty in acute care hospitals. Second, I will discuss the heroic career of Dr. R Adams Cowley, a cardiothoracic surgeon who took some of the principles of cardiac resuscitation and surgery and rapid military evacuation of the wounded from the battlefield, and applied them to the resuscitation and transport of the severely injured trauma patient to a fully prepared and equipped trauma center, and also created an organized approach to trauma care in Maryland. Third, I will provide an overview of the subsequent development of a comprehensive emergency medical system in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Finally, I will emphasize what prevents good public health policy regarding emergency medical and trauma care, and some of the changes that must be made to ensure that the Commonwealth of Virginia and other states provide optimal care for their citizens through their emergency medical care and trauma systems.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:Delphi technique is a structured process commonly used to developed healthcare quality indicators, but there is a little recommendation for researchers who wish to use it. This study aimed 1) to describe reporting of the Delphi method to develop quality indicators, 2) to discuss specific methodological skills for quality indicators selection 3) to give guidance about this practice.
METHODOLOGY AND MAIN FINDING:Three electronic data bases were searched over a 30 years period (1978-2009). All articles that used the Delphi method to select quality indicators were identified. A standardized data extraction form was developed. Four domains (questionnaire preparation, expert panel, progress of the survey and Delphi results) were assessed. Of 80 included studies, quality of reporting varied significantly between items (9\% for year's number of experience of the experts to 98\% for the type of Delphi used). Reporting of methodological aspects needed to evaluate the reliability of the survey was insufficient: only 39\% (31/80) of studies reported response rates for all rounds, 60\% (48/80) that feedback was given between rounds, 77\% (62/80) the method used to achieve consensus and 57\% (48/80) listed quality indicators selected at the end of the survey. A modified Delphi procedure was used in 49/78 (63\%) with a physical meeting of the panel members, usually between Delphi rounds. Median number of panel members was 17(Q1:11; Q3:31). In 40/70 (57\%) studies, the panel included multiple stakeholders, who were healthcare professionals in 95\% (38/40) of cases. Among 75 studies describing criteria to select quality indicators, 28 (37\%) used validity and 17(23\%) feasibility.

CONCLUSION:The use and reporting of the Delphi method for quality indicators selection need to be improved. We provide some guidance to the investigators to improve the using and reporting of the method in future surveys.}},

The disease causes SARS with a significant morbidity and mortality. We provide a review with a focus on COVID-19 in dermatology. We discuss triage of suspected infectious patients, protection of medical doctors and nurses. We discuss the available data on cutaneous symptoms, although disease-specific symptoms have yet not been observed. COVID-19 is a challenge for the treatment of dermatologic patients, either with severe inflammatory disorders or with skin cancer. The consequences for systemic treatment are obvious but it will be most important to collect the clinical data for a better decision process. Last but not least, education in dermatology for students will not be temporarily possible in the classical settings.

abstract = {{ Introduction Triage is a key principle in the effective management of major incidents. The process currently relies on algorithms assigning patients to specific triage categories; there is, however, little guidance as to what these categories represent. Previously, these algorithms were validated against injury severity scores, but it is accepted now that the need for life-saving intervention is a more important outcome. However, the definition of a life-saving intervention is unclear. The aim of this study was to define what constitutes a life-saving intervention, in order to facilitate the definition of an adult priority one patient during the definitive care phase of a major incident. Methods We conducted a modified Delphi study, using a panel of subject matter experts drawn from the United Kingdom and Republic of South Africa with a background in Emergency Care or Major Incident Management. The study was conducted using an online survey tool, over three rounds between July and December 2013. A four point Likert scale was used to seek consensus for 50 possible interventions, with a consensus level set at 70\%. Results 24 participants completed all three rounds of the Delphi, with 32 life-saving interventions reaching consensus. Conclusions This study provides a consensus definition of what constitutes a life-saving intervention in the context of an adult, priority one patient during the definitive care phase of a major incident. The definition will contribute to further research into major incident triage, specifically in terms of validation of an adult major incident triage tool.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:As complete reporting is essential to judge the validity and applicability of multivariable prediction models, a guideline for the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) was introduced. We assessed the completeness of reporting of prediction model studies published just before the introduction of the TRIPOD statement, to refine and tailor its implementation strategy.
METHODS:Within each of 37 clinical domains, 10 journals with the highest journal impact factor were selected. A PubMed search was performed to identify prediction model studies published before the launch of TRIPOD in these journals (May 2014). Eligible publications reported on the development or external validation of a multivariable prediction model (either diagnostic or prognostic) or on the incremental value of adding a predictor to an existing model.

RESULTS:We included 146 publications (84\% prognostic), from which we assessed 170 models: 73 (43\%) on model development, 43 (25\%) on external validation, 33 (19\%) on incremental value, and 21 (12\%) on combined development and external validation of the same model. Overall, publications adhered to a median of 44\% (25th-75th percentile 35-52\%) of TRIPOD items, with 44\% (35-53\%) for prognostic and 41\% (34-48\%) for diagnostic models. TRIPOD items that were completely reported for less than 25\% of the models concerned abstract (2\%), title (5\%), blinding of predictor assessment (6\%), comparison of development and validation data (11\%), model updating (14\%), model performance (14\%), model specification (17\%), characteristics of participants (21\%), model performance measures (methods) (21\%), and model-building procedures (24\%). Most often reported were TRIPOD items regarding overall interpretation (96\%), source of data (95\%), and risk groups (90\%).

CONCLUSIONS:More than half of the items considered essential for transparent reporting were not fully addressed in publications of multivariable prediction model studies. Essential information for using a model in individual risk prediction, i.e. model specifications and model performance, was incomplete for more than 80\% of the models. Items that require improved reporting are title, abstract, and model-building procedures, as they are crucial for identification and external validation of prediction models.}},

It employs recursive binary partitioning algorithm that splits the sample in partitioning variable with the strongest association with the response variable. The process continues until some stopping criteria are met. In the example I focus on conditional inference tree, which incorporates tree-structured regression models into conditional inference procedures. While growing a single tree is subject to small changes in the training data, random forests procedure is introduced to address this problem. The sources of diversity for random forests come from the random sampling and restricted set of input variables to be selected. Finally, I introduce R functions to perform model based recursive partitioning. This method incorporates recursive partitioning into conventional parametric model building.}},

BASIC PROCEDURE:Semistructured interviews were conducted with 24 ED physicians from 4 hospitals to elucidate their experiences of managing chronic pain in the ED.

MAIN FINDINGS:Time limitations and a low triage priority were major barriers to caring for patients with chronic pain. But despite the inherent problems of treating a nonurgent condition in a time-limited setting, physicians were strong proponents for treating chronic pain in the ED.

PRINCIPAL CONCLUSION:Acknowledging that pain can neither be verified nor disproved, physicians tend to err on the side of the patient, often providing an allotment of opioid medications. They also believe that the ED is not an optimal setting for treating patients in chronic pain but that it is often the last resort for many of these patients, thus, providing the rationale for serving them to the best of their ability.}},

abstract = {{Existing global guidance for addressing women's and children's health and nutrition in humanitarian crises is not sufficiently contextualised for conflict settings specifically, reflecting the still-limited evidence that is available from such settings. As a preliminary step towards filling this guidance gap, we propose a conflict-specific framework that aims to guide decision makers focused on the health and nutrition of women and children affected by conflict to prioritise interventions that would address the major causes of mortality and morbidity among women and children in their particular settings and that could also be feasibly delivered in those settings. Assessing local needs, identifying relevant interventions from among those already recommended for humanitarian settings or universally, and assessing the contextual feasibility of delivery for each candidate intervention are key steps in the framework. We illustratively apply the proposed decision making framework to show what a framework-guided selection of priority interventions might look like in three hypothetical conflict contexts that differ in terms of levels of insecurity and patterns of population displacement. In doing so, we aim to catalyse further iteration and eventual field-testing of such a decision making framework by local, national, and international organisations and agencies involved in the humanitarian health response for women and children affected by conflict.}},

abstract = {{This chapter considers only observational ecologic studies. Exploratory ecologic studies are a useful source of hypotheses about individual-level associations that can be followed up in studies that use individuals as the units of measurement and analysis. A narrow focus on individual-level associations may miss important spillover effects. Ecologic studies, in contrast, may detect them. Studies of the effectiveness of community-based intervention programs may involve determining whether presence of the law, policy, or program in a population is associated with a lower rate of adverse outcomes in that population. Because primary scientific interest focuses on group-level associations, ecologic studies are well matched to this purpose. The chapter discusses the design considerations in ecologic studies. It also focuses on concerns of special relevance to ecologic studies particularly when they are used for evaluating legal interventions, drawing freely on the Campbell and Stanley formulation.}},

The application of ATLS guidelines and introduction of management by means of trauma team (TT) both took place in April 2011. The aim of the present study was to evaluate related effects on mortality in the shock room (SR) and at 24 hours after admission.
METHODS:Data were retrieved by administrative software based on patient admission for trauma of at least 48 hours. Study period was from April 2011 to December 2012, and control period was from January 2007 to March 2011. All admitted patients were identified by first diagnosis (ICD 9-CM), excluding traumatic brain injuries, and only patients admitted to the general intensive care, general surgery, and orthopedics units were included.

RESULTS:The control group (CG) included 198 patients; the study group (SG) included 141. Differences were determined in patient age, which was mean 45.2 years (SD: 19.2) in the CG and mean 49.3 years (SD±18.3) in the SG (p=0.03). Differences were not found regarding gender, length of hospital stay, or Injury Severity Score (ISS). Among the patients who died, no differences were found in terms of systolic blood pressure, metabolic acidosis, or packed red blood cell consumption. Mortality was significantly higher in the CG, compared to the SG (14.1\% vs 7.1\%, respectively; p=0.033; confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.95). Mortality in the shock room was significantly lower in the SG, compared to the CG (0.7\% vs 7.1\%, respectively; p=0.002; CI: 0.004-0.592).

CONCLUSION:The introduction of ATLS guidelines and TT had a positive impact on mortality in the first 24 hours, both in the SR and after admission.}},

Mortality rates were compared between states with and without trauma systems. Results: As of 1995, 22 states had regional trauma systems. States with trauma systems had a 9\% lower crude injury mortality rate than those without. When MVC-related mortality was evaluated separately, there was a 17\% reduction in deaths. After controlling for age, state speed laws, restraint laws, and population distribution, there remained a 9\% reduction in MVC-related mortality rate in states with a trauma system. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that a state trauma system is associated with a reduction in the risk of death caused by injury. The effect is most evident on analysis of MVC deaths....}},

Based on data from the CRASH-2 trial, global mortality data and a systematic literature review, we estimated the number of premature deaths that might be averted every year worldwide through the use of TXA. We used CRASH-2 trial data to examine the effect of TXA on death due to bleeding by geographical region. We used WHO mortality data (2008) and data from a systematic review of the literature to estimate the annual number of in-hospital trauma deaths due to bleeding. We then used the relative risk estimates from the CRASH-2 trial to estimate the number of premature deaths that could be averted if all hospitalised bleeding trauma patients received TXA within one hour of injury, and within three hours of injury. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the effect of uncertainty in the parameter estimates and the assumptions made in the model. There is no evidence that the effect of TXA on death due to bleeding varies by geographical region (heterogeneity p = 0.70). Based on WHO data and our systematic literature review, we estimate that each year worldwide there are approximately 400,000 in-hospital trauma deaths due to bleeding. If patients received TXA within one hour of injury then approximately 128,000 (uncertainty range [UR] ≈ 72,000 to 172,000) deaths might be averted. If patients received TXA within three hours of injury then approximately 112,000 (UR ≈ 68,000 to 148,000) deaths might be averted. Country specific estimates show that the largest numbers of deaths averted would be in India and China. The use of TXA in the treatment of traumatic bleeding has the potential to prevent many premature deaths every year. A large proportion of the potential health gains are in low and middle income countries.}},

METHODS:Validity was investigated by behavioural experts sorting 112 unique theoretical constructs using closed and open sort tasks. The extent of replication was tested by Discriminant Content Validation and Fuzzy Cluster Analysis.

RESULTS:There was good support for a refinement of the framework comprising 14 domains of theoretical constructs (average silhouette value 0.29): 'Knowledge', 'Skills', 'Social/Professional Role and Identity', 'Beliefs about Capabilities', 'Optimism', 'Beliefs about Consequences', 'Reinforcement', 'Intentions', 'Goals', 'Memory, Attention and Decision Processes', 'Environmental Context and Resources', 'Social Influences', 'Emotions', and 'Behavioural Regulation'.

CONCLUSIONS:The refined Theoretical Domains Framework has a strengthened empirical base and provides a method for theoretically assessing implementation problems, as well as professional and other health-related behaviours as a basis for intervention development.}},

We aimed to estimate the out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure and catastrophic expenditure due to hospitalisation or outpatient care as a result of any injury and factors associated with incurring catastrophic expenditure.
METHODS:Secondary analysis of nationally representative data for India collected by National Sample Survey Organization in 2014, reporting on health service utilisation and healthcare-related OOP expenditure by income quintiles and by type of health facility (public or private).

RESULTS:The median expenditure per episode of hospitalisation due to any injury was US\$156, and it was three times higher among the richest quintile compared with the poorest quintile (p<0.001). There was a significantly higher prevalence (p<0.001) of catastrophic expenditure among the poorest quintile (32\%) compared with the richest (21\%). Mean private sector OOP hospitalisation expenditure was five times higher than in the public sector (p<0.001). Medicines accounted for 37\% and 58\% of public sector hospitalisation and outpatient care, respectively. Patients treated in a private facility, hospitalised for over 7 days, in the poorest wealth quintiles and of general caste had higher odds of incurring catastrophic expenditure.

CONCLUSION:People who sustain an injury have a high risk of catastrophic household expenditure, particularly for those in lowest income quartiles. There is a clear need for publicly funded risk protection mechanisms targeting the poor. Promotion of generic medicines and subsidisation for the poorest wealth quintile may also reduce OOP expenditure in public sector facilities.}},

abstract = {{Abstract Background In emergency medical services (EMSs), accurately predicting the severity of a patient’s medical condition is important for the early identification of those who are vulnerable and at high-risk. In this study, we developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based on deep learning to predict the need for critical care during EMS. Methods We conducted a retrospective observation cohort study. The algorithm was established using development data from the Korean national emergency department information system, which were collected during visits in real time from 151 emergency departments (EDs). We validated the algorithm using EMS run sheets from two EDs. The study subjects comprised adult patients who visited EDs. The endpoint was critical care, and we used age, sex, chief complaint, symptom onset to arrival time, trauma, and initial vital signs as the predicted variables. Results The number of patients in the development data was 8,981,181, and the validation data comprised 2604 EMS run sheets from two hospitals. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the algorithm to predict the critical care was 0.867 (95\% confidence interval, [0.864–0.871]). This result outperformed the Emergency Severity Index (0.839 [0.831–0.846]), Korean Triage and Acuity System (0.824 [0.815–0.832]), National Early Warning Score (0.741 [0.734–0.748]), and Modified Early Warning Score (0.696 [0.691–0.699]). Conclusions The AI algorithm accurately predicted the need for the critical care of patients using information during EMS and outperformed the conventional triage tools and early warning scores.}},

The simulations were based on data from a cardiac trial of 673 patients in which 252 deaths occurred and seven variables were cogent predictors of mortality; the number of events per predictive variable was (252/7 =) 36 for the full sample. For the simulations, at values of EPV = 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, we randomly generated 500 samples of the 673 patients, chosen with replacement, according to a logistic model derived from the full sample. Simulation results for the regression coefficients for each variable in each group of 500 samples were compared for bias, precision, and significance testing against the results of the model fitted to the original sample. For EPV values of 10 or greater, no major problems occurred. For EPV values less than 10, however, the regression coefficients were biased in both positive and negative directions; the large sample variance estimates from the logistic model both overestimated and underestimated the sample variance of the regression coefficients; the 90\% confidence limits about the estimated values did not have proper coverage; the Wald statistic was conservative under the null hypothesis; and paradoxical associations (significance in the wrong direction) were increased. Although other factors (such as the total number of events, or sample size) may influence the validity of the logistic model, our findings indicate that low EPV can lead to major problems.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Trauma represents a major global health problem projected to increase in importance over the next decade. The majority of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where survival rates are lower than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Health system level changes in care for injured patients have been attributed to significant improvements in care quality and outcomes in HIC settings. There is a need for further research to assess trauma care health systems in LMICs to inform health system strengthening for the care of the injured. This study aims to conduct a narrative synthesis of a systematic search of the literature on the assessment of trauma care health systems in LMICs in order to inform the further development of trauma care health system assessment.
METHODS:The review will include primary quantitative, qualitative or mixed method studies and secondary literature reviews. No restriction will be placed on language or date. Reports and publications identified from the grey literature including from relevant national and international health organisations will be included. Articles will be screened by two independent reviewers with a third reviewer resolving any persisting disagreement. The search will reveal heterogenous studies not suitable for meta-analysis. A narrative synthesis of the identified papers will be conducted to identify key methodological ideas and paradigms used to assess trauma care health systems. The analysis will consider how the differing methodological approaches could be adopted to understand barriers and delays to seeking, reaching and receiving care within a "Three Delays" framework. An iterative approach will be adopted to categorise identified articles, with the results presented as both within and across study analysis.

DISCUSSION:The results of the review will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed academic journal. The study forms part of a PhD project. The results will inform the development of a trauma care health system assessment applicable to LMICs. As this is a review of secondary data, no formal ethical approval is required.

This paper uses three case studies to investigate the political, societal, and local factors that propelled emergency medicine along this path. The case studies-Alexandria Hospital, Hartford Hospital, and Yale-New Haven Hospital-demonstrate that the changes in emergency medicine began at small community hospitals and later spread to urban teaching hospitals. These changes were primarily a response to public demand. The government, the American public, and the medical community brought emergency medical care to the forefront of national attention in the sixties. Simultaneously, patients' relationships with their general practitioners dissolved. As patients started to use the emergency room for non-urgent health problems, emergency visits increased astronomically. In response to rising patient loads and mounting criticism, hospital administrators devised strategies to improve emergency care. Drawing on hospital archives, oral histories, and statistical data, I will argue that small community hospitals' hiring of full-time emergency physicians sparked the development of a new specialty. Urban teaching hospitals, which established triage systems and ambulatory care facilities, resisted the idea of emergency medicine and ultimately delayed its development.}},

From our own experience and the literature, we share several lessons for developing such models in settings where the data necessary for algorithm training and implementation is a limited resource. First, the training cohort should be as similar as possible to the population of interest, and recalibration can be used to improve risk estimates when a model is transported to a new context. Second, algorithms should incorporate existing data sources or data that is easily obtainable by frontline health workers or assistants in order to optimize available resources and facilitate integration into clinical practice. Third, the Super Learner ensemble machine learning algorithm can be used to define the optimal model for a given prediction problem while minimizing bias in the algorithm selection process. By considering the right population, right resources, and right algorithm, researchers can train prediction models that are both context-appropriate and resource-conscious. There remain gaps in data availability, affordable computing capacity, and implementation studies that hinder clinical algorithm development and use in low-resource settings, although these barriers are decreasing over time. We advocate for researchers to create open-source code, apps, and training materials to allow new machine learning models to be adapted to different populations and contexts in order to support surgical providers and health care systems in low- and middle-income countries worldwide.}},

It provides entry points into the literature on randomized trial methodology. The idea for a randomized trial usually originates from interest in the effects of a particular intervention, which becomes one arm of the trial. Random allocation, the feature that distinguishes a randomized trial from other study designs, is responsible for the substantial advantages of this design. Two issues of randomization are at stake. One is whether the assignment sequence that specifies which subject goes to which intervention arm is truly random. The other is allocation concealment, whether the intervention assignment of a subject is adequately hidden from persons involved in deciding whether and when the subject enters the trial. The data analysis is usually to compare the intervention groups on baseline characteristics.}},

We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble. We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.

abstract = {{To date, there are no reviews on machine learning (ML) for predicting outcomes in trauma. Consequently, it remains unclear as to how ML-based prediction models compare in the triage and assessment of trauma patients. The objective of this review was to survey and identify studies involving ML for predicting outcomes in trauma, with the hypothesis that models predicting similar outcomes may share common features but the performance of ML in these studies will differ greatly. MEDLINE and other databases were searched for studies involving trauma and ML. Sixty-five observational studies involving ML for the prediction of trauma outcomes met inclusion criteria. In total 2,433,180 patients were included in the studies. The studies focused on prediction of the following outcome measures: survival/mortality (n = 34), morbidity/shock/hemorrhage (n = 12), hospital length of stay (n = 7), hospital admission/triage (n = 6), traumatic brain injury (n = 4), life-saving interventions (n = 5), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 4), and transfusion (n = 1). Six studies were prospective observational studies. Of the 65 studies, 33 used artificial neural networks for prediction. Importantly, most studies demonstrated the benefits of ML models. However, algorithm performance was assessed differently by different authors. Sensitivity-specificity gap values varied greatly from 0.035 to 0.927. Notably, studies shared many features for model development. A common ML feature base may be determined for predicting outcomes in trauma. However, the impact of ML will require further validation in prospective observational studies and randomized clinical trials, establishment of common performance criteria, and high-quality evidence about clinical and economic impacts before ML can be widely accepted in practice.}},

However, psychological researchers may be relatively unequipped to analyze such data, given its many characteristics and the general complexities involved in longitudinal modeling. The current paper introduces time series analysis to psychological research, an analytic domain that has been essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of variables across many diverse fields. First, the characteristics of time series data are discussed. Second, different time series modeling techniques are surveyed that can address various topics of interest to psychological researchers, including describing the pattern of change in a variable, modeling seasonal effects, assessing the immediate and long-term impact of a salient event, and forecasting future values. To illustrate these methods, an illustrative example based on online job search behavior is used throughout the paper, and a software tutorial in R for these analyses is provided in the Appendix.}},

However, the success of the Advanced Trauma Life Support course is difficult to reproduce in developing countries due to set-up costs, limitations of resources, and variations of practice. The objective of this study is to assess the Trauma Evaluation and Management (TEAM) course as a low-cost alternative for trauma resuscitation teaching in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC).
DESIGN:As part of the Team Broken Earth initiative, TEAM course was provided to the health care professionals in Haiti. At its conclusion, participants were asked to complete a survey evaluating the course. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed to evaluate the perception of the course.

SETTING:The course was provided in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

PARTICIPANTS:A total of 80 health care professionals participated in the course. Response was obtained from 69 participants, which comprised of 32 physicians, 10 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), 22 nurses, and 5 medical trainees.

RESULTS:The course was well received by physicians, nurses, and EMT with an average score of 90.6\%. Question analysis revealed a lower satisfaction of physicians for the course manual and teaching materials, and information related to decisions for transfer of patients. EMT consistently felt that the course was not tailored to their learning and practice needs. Written feedback demonstrated several areas of weaknesses including need for improvements in translations, hands-on practice, and educational materials.

CONCLUSIONS:Overall, the TEAM course was well received. Analysis demonstrated a need for adjustments specific to LMIC including a focus on prehospital assessment, increased nursing responsibilities, and unavailability of specialist's referrals. Team Broken Earth intends to take these findings into consideration and continue to provide the TEAM course to other LMIC.}},

The advantages, disadvantages, and underlying assumptions of various modelling approaches are discussed using published examples \#\#\#\# Summary points Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the ideal approach for assessing the effectiveness of interventions. However, not all interventions can be assessed with an RCT, whereas for many interventions trials can be prohibitively expensive. In addition, even well designed RCTs can be susceptible to systematic errors leading to biased estimates, particularly when generalising results to “real world” settings. For example, the external validity of clinical trials in diabetes seems to be poor; the proportion of the Scottish population that met eligibility criteria for seven major clinical trials ranged from 3.5\% to 50.7\%.1 One of the greatest concerns is patients with multimorbidity, who are commonly excluded from RCTs.2 Observational studies can address some of these shortcomings, but the lack of researcher control over confounding variables and the difficulty in establishing causation mean that conclusions from studies using observational approaches are generally considered to be weaker. However, with quasi-experimental study designs researchers are able to estimate causal effects using observational approaches. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis is a useful quasi-experimental design with which to evaluate the longitudinal effects of interventions, through regression modelling.3 The term quasi-experimental refers to an absence of randomisation, and ITS analysis is principally a tool for analysing observational data where full randomisation, or a case-control …}},

Little data exist to suggest which prehospital criteria should serve as potential filters. This study identifies the most important filters for auditing prehospital trauma care using a Delphi technique to achieve consensus of expert opinion. Methods: Experts in trauma care from the United States (n \&equals; 81) were asked to generate filters of potential utility in monitoring the prehospital aspect of the trauma system, and were then required to rank these questions in order of importance to identify those of greatest importance. Results: Twenty-eight filters ranking in the highest tertile are proposed. The majority (54\%) pertains to aspects of emergency medical services, which comprise 7 of the top 10 (70\%) filters. Triage filters follow in priority ranking, comprising 29\% of the final list. Filters concerning interfacility transfers and transportation ranked lowest. Conclusion: This study identifies audit filters representing the most important aspects of prehospital trauma care that merit continued evaluation and monitoring. A subsequent trial addressing the utility of these filters could potentially enhance the sensitivity of identifying deviations in prehospital care, standardize the performance improvement process, and translate into an improvement in patient care and outcome.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Scoping studies are an increasingly popular approach to reviewing health research evidence. In 2005, Arksey and O'Malley published the first methodological framework for conducting scoping studies. While this framework provides an excellent foundation for scoping study methodology, further clarifying and enhancing this framework will help support the consistency with which authors undertake and report scoping studies and may encourage researchers and clinicians to engage in this process.
DISCUSSION:We build upon our experiences conducting three scoping studies using the Arksey and O'Malley methodology to propose recommendations that clarify and enhance each stage of the framework. Recommendations include: clarifying and linking the purpose and research question (stage one); balancing feasibility with breadth and comprehensiveness of the scoping process (stage two); using an iterative team approach to selecting studies (stage three) and extracting data (stage four); incorporating a numerical summary and qualitative thematic analysis, reporting results, and considering the implications of study findings to policy, practice, or research (stage five); and incorporating consultation with stakeholders as a required knowledge translation component of scoping study methodology (stage six). Lastly, we propose additional considerations for scoping study methodology in order to support the advancement, application and relevance of scoping studies in health research.

SUMMARY:Specific recommendations to clarify and enhance this methodology are outlined for each stage of the Arksey and O'Malley framework. Continued debate and development about scoping study methodology will help to maximize the usefulness and rigor of scoping study findings within healthcare research and practice.}},

abstract = {{Machine learning (ML) modeling of the human microbiome has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Progress has been made toward developing ML models that predict health outcomes using bacterial abundances, but inconsistent adoption of training and evaluation methods call the validity of these models into question. Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs) (n = 490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1- and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.695 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.651 to 0.739) but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 (IQR, 0.625 to 0.735), trained faster (12 min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability. IMPORTANCE Diagnosing diseases using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these models is likely overoptimistic. Moreover, there is a trend toward using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step toward developing more-reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of human health but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.}},

Until now, research on the association between sex and trauma patient outcomes mainly focused on patients in Europe and the United States. Our research attempted to determine whether the female sex is associated with a survival advantage among severely injured Chinese trauma patients. A retrospective analysis of data derived from the Emergency Intensive Care Unit of the Shanghai Sixth People’;s Hospital Acute Trauma Center during 2010 to 2013 was performed to characterize differences in sex-based outcomes after severe blunt trauma. The patient study cohort (858 Asian subjects) was then stratified by age and injury severity (using the Injury Severity Score [ISS]). Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to evaluate the association between sex and nosocomial infection rate and hospitalized mortality, both overall and by age and ISS category subgroups. Among all trauma patients, females had a significantly lower risk of in-hospital mortality compared with males (OR, 0.41; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 0.20 – 0.85). This difference was most apparent for patients younger than 50 years (OR, 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.12 – 0.82) and the group with ISS scores of 25 or higher (OR, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.17 – 0.91). No differences in the development of nosocomial infections between sexes were seen among the overall patient group and subgroups. This study revealed a statistically significant association between sex and mortality among severe blunt trauma patients, particularly those patients younger than 50 years and with ISSs of 25 or higher. Women had significantly lower mortality than men after severe blunt trauma. These results highlight the important role of sex hormones and sex-based outcome differences after severe traumatic injury in the Chinese population....}},

In the medical field, clustering has been proven to be a powerful tool for discovering patterns and structure in labeled and unlabeled datasets. Unlike supervised methods, clustering is an unsupervised method that works on datasets in which there is no outcome (target) variable nor is anything known about the relationship between the observations, that is, unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on studying and reviewing clustering methods that have been applied to datasets of neurological diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aim is to provide insights into which clustering technique is more suitable for partitioning patients of AD based on their similarity. This is important as clustering algorithms can find patterns across patients that are difficult for medical practitioners to find. We further discuss the implications of the use of clustering algorithms in the treatment of AD. We found that clustering analysis can point to several features that underlie the conversion from early-stage AD to advanced AD. Furthermore, future work can apply semi-clustering algorithms on AD datasets, which will enhance clusters by including additional information.}},

abstract = {{Critical illness is any immediately life-threatening disease or trauma and results in several million deaths globally every year. Responsive hospital systems for managing critical illness include quick and accurate identification of the critically ill patients. Prognostic prediction models are widely used for this aim. To be clinically useful, a model should have good predictive performance, often measured using discrimination and calibration. This is not sufficient though: a model also needs to be tested in the setting where it will be used, it should be user-friendly and should guide decision making and actions. The clinical usefulness and impact on patient outcomes of prediction models has not been greatly studied. The focus of research should shift from attempts to optimise the precision of models to real-world intervention studies to compare the performance of models and their impacts on outcomes.}},

abstract = {{Abstract: The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic \&lsqb;ROC\&rsqb; curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration. Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions. We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n \&equals; 544 for model development, n \&equals; 273 for external validation). We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Each year, thousands of surgeons and other trauma health care providers participate in the American College of Surgeon's Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, which historically has allowed trainees to practice cricothyroidotomy, chest tube insertion, pericardiocentesis, venous cutdown, and diagnostic peritoneal lavage on live dogs, pigs, sheep, and goats. However, more than 99\% of ATLS programs in the United States and Canada have now ended animal use, driven primarily by simulation technology advancements.
OBJECTIVE:This review details an international survey of animal versus simulation use in ATLS programs and summarizes the surgical training impact of a novel collaboration between the industry manufacturer of the TraumaMan human simulator, Simulab Corporation (Seattle, Washington), and an animal protection nongovernmental organization (NGO) based in Norfolk, Virginia, to replace animal use in ATLS programs with human simulators.

METHODS:From 2012 through 2017, the NGO e-mailed formal surveys concerning program statistics and animal use practices to ATLS officials in various countries (N = 64). The survey response rate was 87.5\% and included pre- and post-comparison surveys relative to the industry-NGO simulation collaboration.

RESULTS:Eighteen ATLS programs (32.1\%) initially replied that they use nonanimal training methods, whereas 38 ATLS programs (67.8\%) replied that they use animals for surgical skills training and cited financial constraints as the primary barrier to adopting human simulation methods. Through the industry-NGO collaboration, the NGO donated 119 TraumaMan models valued at nearly \$3 million (USD) to ATLS programs in 22 countries, such that 75\% of those ATLS programs surveyed by the NGO now use exclusively nonanimal simulation models.

CONCLUSIONS:The industry-NGO collaboration successfully transformed the surgical skills laboratories of 22 international ATLS programs to replace animal use with nonanimal simulation models that are more anatomically realistic, cost less, and allow trainees to repeat surgical skills until proficiency.}},

A quantitative analysis demonstrated that subsequent incorporation of primary trauma care algorithms did not occur. The purpose of this qualitative analysis is to explore why the delivery of the primary trauma care curriculum did not have a measurable effect on provider observance of primary trauma care algorithms. Key informant interviews of primary trauma care instructors and students, trauma care observers, and hospital administrators involved in the delivery of the primary trauma care curriculum were conducted in February 2015. Interview transcripts were analyzed qualitatively using a grounded-theory approach and thematic analysis for insights and common themes. Four common themes emerged to explain why adherence to primary trauma care algorithms did not improve: Primary Trauma Care course delivery problems, insufficient equipment, insufficient nurse training, and unsystematic team response. Despite the delivery of the primary trauma care curriculum, adherence to the primary trauma care algorithms did not improve as a result of problems integral to the primary trauma care model—including the teach-the-teachers method of curriculum dissemination—as well as local conditions at this hospital. These findings suggest that an isolated educational intervention may not be successful unless the host institution is able to commit to the implementation of the educational material in an ongoing and comprehensive fashion.}},

abstract = {{Retrospective trauma scores are often used to categorise trauma, however, they have little utility in the prehospital or hyper-acute setting and do not define major trauma to non-specialists. This study employed a Delphi process in order to gauge degrees of consensus/disagreement amongst expert panel members to define major trauma. A two round modified Delphi technique was used to explore subject-expert consensus and identify variables to define major trauma through systematically collating questionnaire responses. After initial descriptive analysis of variables, Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in response to the Delphi statements between professional groups. A hierarchical cluster analysis was undertaken to identify patterns of similarity/difference of response. A grounded theory approach to qualitative analysis of data allowed for potentially multiple iterations of the Delphi process to be influenced by identified themes. Of 55 expert panel members invited to participate, round 1 had 43 participants (Doctor n = 20, Paramedic n = 20, Nurse n = 5, other n = 2). No consistent patterns of opinion emerged with regards to professional group. Cluster analysis identified three patterns of similar responses and coded as trauma minimisers, the middle ground and the risk averse. Round 2 had 35 respondents with minimum change in opinion between rounds. Consensus of > 70\% was achieved on many variables which included the identification of life/limb threatening injuries, deranged physiology, need for intensive care interventions and that extremes of age need special consideration. It was also acknowledged that retrospective injury severity scoring has a role to play but is not the only method of defining major trauma. Various factors had a majority of agreement/disagreement but did not meet the pre-set criteria of 70\% agreement. These included the topics of burns, spinal immobilisation and whether a major trauma centre is the only place where major trauma can be managed. Based upon the output of this Delphi study, major trauma may be defined as: “Significant injury or injuries that have potential to be life-threatening or life-changing sustained from either high energy mechanisms or low energy mechanisms in those rendered vulnerable by extremes of age”.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Emergency department crowding is a major global healthcare issue. There is much debate as to the causes of the phenomenon, leading to difficulties in developing successful, targeted solutions.
AIM:The aim of this systematic review was to critically analyse and summarise the findings of peer-reviewed research studies investigating the causes and consequences of, and solutions to, emergency department crowding.

METHOD:The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A structured search of four databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science) was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed research publications aimed at investigating the causes or consequences of, or solutions to, emergency department crowding, published between January 2000 and June 2018. Two reviewers used validated critical appraisal tools to independently assess the quality of the studies. The study protocol was registered with the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017073439).

RESULTS:From 4,131 identified studies and 162 full text reviews, 102 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority were retrospective cohort studies, with the greatest proportion (51\%) trialling or modelling potential solutions to emergency department crowding. Fourteen studies examined causes and 40 investigated consequences. Two studies looked at both causes and consequences, and two investigated causes and solutions.

CONCLUSIONS:The negative consequences of ED crowding are well established, including poorer patient outcomes and the inability of staff to adhere to guideline-recommended treatment. This review identified a mismatch between causes and solutions. The majority of identified causes related to the number and type of people attending ED and timely discharge from ED, while reported solutions focused on efficient patient flow within the ED. Solutions aimed at the introduction of whole-of-system initiatives to meet timed patient disposition targets, as well as extended hours of primary care, demonstrated promising outcomes. While the review identified increased presentations by the elderly with complex and chronic conditions as an emerging and widespread driver of crowding, more research is required to isolate the precise local factors leading to ED crowding, with system-wide solutions tailored to address identified causes.}},

While the Ottawa Statement on the ethical design and conduct of cluster randomized trials provides guidance for researchers and research ethics committees, it does not explicitly focus on low- and middle-income settings. In this paper, we use the lens of the Ottawa Statement to analyze two cluster randomized trials conducted in low- and middle-income settings in order to identify gaps or ethical issues requiring further analysis and guidance. The PolyIran trial was a parallel-arm, cluster trial examining the effectiveness of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease in Golestan province, Iran. The PASTAL trial was an adaptive, multistage, parallel-arm, cluster trial evaluating the effect of incentives for human immunodeficiency virus self-testing and follow-up on male partners of pregnant women in Malawi. Through an in-depth case analysis of these two studies we highlight several issues in need of further exploration. First, standards for verbal consent and waivers of consent require methods for operationalization if they are to be employed consistently. Second, the appropriate choice of a control arm remains contentious. Particularly in the case of implementation interventions, locally available care is required as the comparator to address questions of comparative effectiveness. However, locally available care might be lower than standards set out in national guidelines. Third, while the need for access to effective interventions post-trial is widely recognized, it is often not possible to guarantee this upfront. Clarity on what is required of researchers and sponsors is needed. Fourth, there is a pressing need for ethics education and capacity building regarding cluster randomized trials in these settings. We identify four issues in cluster randomized trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries for which further ethical analysis and guidance is required.}},

This study aimed to summarize the literature assessing surgical capacity in LMICs to provide a current assessment of trauma capacity, which will help guide future efforts.Materials and methodsThe MEDLINE database was queried via PubMed to identify studies assessing baseline surgical capacity in individual LMICs. Data were collected from each study by extracting the relevant information from the full-published text or tables. Trauma capacity was evaluated using 12 surrogate criteria of trauma care, including laparotomy, cricothyroidotomy and chest tube insertion capabilities, and accessibility to a blood bank.ResultsSeventeen studies were reviewed, documenting data from 531 hospitals in seventeen countries. None of the countries had access to all twelve trauma criteria in all their hospitals. Endotracheal intubation and cricothyrotomy or tracheostomy were available at 48\% (107/222) and 41\% (163/418) of facilities, respectively. Bag mask valves were available at 61\% (234/383) of the institutions. Although 87\% (193/221) of facilities responded that they were able to provide initial resuscitation, only 48\% (169/349) of them had access to a blood bank and 70\% (191/271) had access to intravenous fluids. A third or less of district hospitals had access to basic resuscitation (33\%; 8/24), endotracheal tubes (32\%; 31/97), blood banks (31\%; 32/102), and cricothyrotomies and/or tracheostomies (32\%; 30/95).ConclusionsDeficiencies in trauma capacity in LMICs remain widespread.

Using propensity score matching, we find that access to improved sanitation reduces the risk of contracting diarrhea by 2.2 percentage points. There is considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of improved sanitation. We find statistically insignificant treatment effects for children in low or middle socioeconomic status households and for girls; however, boys and children in high socioeconomic status households experienced economically significant treatment effects.

abstract = {{It has been stated that the Franco-German Emergency Medical Services System (FGS) has considerable drawbacks compared to the Anglo-American Emergency Medical Services System (AAS): 1. The key differences between the AAS and the FGS are that in the AAS, the patients is brought to the doctor, while in the FGS, the doctor is brought to the patient. 2. In the FGS, patients with urgent conditions usually are evaluated and treated by general practitioners in their offices or at the patient's home; initially, very few approach an emergency department. 3. Emergency patients with life-threatening trauma or disease are treated by emergency physicians at the scene and during transport. Paramedics often are first to arrive at the scene, and until the emergency physician arrives at the scene, are allowed to defibrillate, to intubate endotracheally, and to administer life-saving drugs (epinephrine endotracheally, glucose intravenously, etc.). 4. Prehospital emergency physicians treat patients at the scene and during transport. 5. Emergency patients are guaranteed to be reached by an appropriate emergency vehicle and a respective crew within 10 minutes in 80\% of the responses and within 15 minutes in 95\% of cases. 6. The FGS deploys qualified emergency physicians assisted by qualified paramedics as prehospital intensive care providers; extended immediate care is standard. Total Prehospital Times (TPT) and scene times only are minimally longer than in the AAS. 7. Emergency Medicine is recognized as a supra-specialty to the base specialties. Specific training programs exist for emergency physicians, medical directors of emergency medical services systems (EMSS), and chief emergency physicians (CEP). 8. Resuscitation attempts are carried out not only by anesthesiologists, but also by internists, surgeons, pediatricians, etc. Emergency medicine encompasses cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shock cases, and patients with an acute myocardial infarction, stroke, poly-trauma, status asthmaticus, etc. Emergency patients are admitted directly to emergency departments of the hospitals, which, depending upon the size of the hospital. 9. The incidence of life-threatening trauma victims has decreased to <10\% in the FGS. Of a total of 830,000 deaths/year, fatal trauma cases ranked the lowest at 4\%. 10. Survival figures on cardiac arrest (asystole, ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), pulseless electrical activity (PEA, etc.) reported in the German EMSS correspond to those in Europe and the United States. 11. Paramedic training is characterized by a two-year program followed by a theoretical and a practical examination. 12. Paramedics and emergency physicians-in-training are supervised at the scene and during transport. Quality assurance (Q/A) constitutes an integral and legally compulsory part of the EMSS. 13. In the majority of cases, the emergency patients are evaluated and treated by the respective specialties without delays caused by patient transfer to other hospitals. 14. The FGS does not require a greater number of ambulances and/or personnel than does the AAS. 15. The German healthcare system creates less expenses/capita than the does the U.S. system at a similar level of quality of care. 16. Emergency procedures are carried out by anesthesiologists, emergency physicians, surgeons, internists, and other specialists.}},

Quality improvement processes, interventions, and structure are essential in the effort to decrease trauma mortality. A systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional studies assessing quality improvement processes, interventions, and structure in developing country trauma systems was conducted from November 1989 to August 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were included if they were conducted in an LMIC population according to World Bank Income Classification, occurred in a trauma setting, and measured the effect of implementation and its impact. The primary outcome was trauma mortality. Of 37,575 search results, 30 studies were included from 15 LMICs covering five WHO regions in a qualitative synthesis. Twenty-seven articles were included in a meta-analysis. Implementing a pre-hospital trauma system reduced overall trauma mortality by 45\% (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95\% CI 0.4 to 0.75). Training first responders resulted in an overall decrease in mortality (RR 0.47, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.78). In-hospital trauma training with certified courses resulted in a reduction of mortality (RR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.62 to 0.78). Trauma audits and trauma protocols resulted in varying improvements in trauma mortality. There is evidence that quality improvement processes, interventions, and structure can improve mortality in the trauma systems in LMICs.}},

abstract = {{Background Timely access to emergency care can substantially reduce mortality. International benchmarks for access to emergency hospital care have been established to guide ambitions for universal health care by 2030. However, no Pan-African database of where hospitals are located exists; therefore, we aimed to complete a geocoded inventory of hospital services in Africa in relation to how populations might access these services in 2015, with focus on women of child bearing age. Methods We assembled a geocoded inventory of public hospitals across 48 countries and islands of sub-Saharan Africa, including Zanzibar, using data from various sources. We only included public hospitals with emergency services that were managed by governments at national or local levels and faith-based or non-governmental organisations. For hospital listings without geographical coordinates, we geocoded each facility using Microsoft Encarta (version 2009), Google Earth (version 7.3), Geonames, Fallingrain, OpenStreetMap, and other national digital gazetteers. We obtained estimates for total population and women of child bearing age (15–49 years) at a 1 km2 spatial resolution from the WorldPop database for 2015. Additionally, we assembled road network data from Google Map Maker Project and OpenStreetMap using ArcMap (version 10.5). We then combined the road network and the population locations to form a travel impedance surface. Subsequently, we formulated a cost distance algorithm based on the location of public hospitals and the travel impedance surface in AccessMod (version 5) to compute the proportion of populations living within a combined walking and motorised travel time of 2 h to emergency hospital services. Findings We consulted 100 databases from 48 sub-Saharan countries and islands, including Zanzibar, and identified 4908 public hospitals. 2701 hospitals had either full or partial information about their geographical coordinates. We estimated that 287 282 013 (29·0\%) people and 64 495 526 (28·2\%) women of child bearing age are located more than 2-h travel time from the nearest hospital. Marked differences were observed within and between countries, ranging from less than 25\% of the population within 2-h travel time of a public hospital in South Sudan to more than 90\% in Nigeria, Kenya, Cape Verde, Swaziland, South Africa, Burundi, Comoros, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Zanzibar. Only 16 countries reached the international benchmark of more than 80\% of their populations living within a 2-h travel time of the nearest hospital. Interpretation Physical access to emergency hospital care provided by the public sector in Africa remains poor and varies substantially within and between countries. Innovative targeting of emergency care services is necessary to reduce these inequities. This study provides the first spatial census of public hospital services in Africa.

abstract = {{Background Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2–73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3\% (18·5–20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43\% (8·00–8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006–16—age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95\% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178\% (95\% UI 176–181) increase in deaths in ages 90–94 years and a 210\% (208–212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89\%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59\%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

abstract = {{Global health ethics is a relatively new term that is used to conceptualize the process of applying moral value to health issues that are typically characterized by a global level effect or require action coordinated at a global level. It is important to acknowledge that this account of global health ethics takes a predominantly geographic approach and may infer that the subject relates primarily to macro-level health phenomena. However, global health ethics could alternatively be thought of as another branch of health ethics. It may then relate to specific topics in themselves, which might also include micro-level health phenomena. In its broadest sense, global health ethics is a normative project that is best characterized by the challenge of developing common values and universal norms for responding to global health threats. Consequently, many subjects fall within its scope. Whilst several accounts of global health ethics have been conceptualized in the literature, a concise demarcation of the paradigm is still needed. Through means of a literature review, this paper presents a two-part introduction to global health ethics. First, the framework of ‘borrowed’ ethics that currently form the core of global health ethics is discussed in relation to two essential ethical considerations: 1) what is the moral significance of health and 2) what is the moral significance of boundaries? Second, a selection of exemplar ethical topics is presented to illustrate the range of topics within global health ethics.}},

This study aimed to standardise and evaluate an evidence-based intervention for safety, efficacy and quality of post-crash pre-hospital and in-hospital trauma care services to improve the outcome in RTI victims. In addition, it establishes the android-based trauma registry for effective RTI surveillance. This multi-centric, prospective, observational study is commissioned by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as a National Task Force Project. This study is being conducted in five sites, viz., Anand, Bengaluru, Delhi, Lucknow and Thrissur located across India. Each centre will have a level I, two level II and three level III trauma hospitals. The study will be carried out in four phases namely: i) preparatory phase, ii) trauma registry establishment and pre-intervention data collection, iii) intervention and iv) impact evaluation. The preparatory phase, which lasts for four months includes the situational analysis pertaining to managing RTIs. Trauma registry will be initiated from the fifth month. Pre-intervention data will be collected for six months. The intervention will be conducted for six months in the form of prehospital notification, training for trauma care providers and trauma care quality improvement. Post-intervention data collection will continue for 12 months and the impact of the intervention will be assessed. The primary outcome measure will be early preventable mortality, defined as death at 24 hours after admission for patients with a calculated probability of survival >50\% based on their injury severity score.}},

abstract = {{The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease. This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5\% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20\% to 67\% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5\% of patients with COVID-19, and 20\% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75\% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6\% vs 24.6\%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95\% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40\%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Trauma is the leading cause of death in individuals younger than 40 years. There are many different models for predicting patient outcome following trauma. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review has been performed on prognostic models for the general trauma population. Therefore, this review aimed to describe (1) existing mortality prediction models for the general trauma population, (2) the methodological quality and (3) which variables are most relevant for the model prediction of mortality in the general trauma population.
METHODS:An online search was conducted in June 2015 using Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Cinahl, Cochrane, Google Scholar and PubMed. Relevant English peer-reviewed articles that developed, validated or updated mortality prediction models in a general trauma population were included.

RESULTS:A total of 90 articles were included. The cohort sizes ranged from 100 to 1,115,389 patients, with overall mortality rates that ranged from 0.6\% to 35\%. The Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) was the most commonly used model. A total of 258 models were described in the articles, of which only 103 models (40\%) were externally validated. Cases with missing values were often excluded and discrimination of the different prediction models ranged widely (AUROC between 0.59 and 0.98). The predictors were often included as dichotomized or categorical variables, while continuous variables showed better performance.

CONCLUSION:Researchers are still searching for a better mortality prediction model in the general trauma population. Models should 1) be developed and/or validated using an adequate sample size with sufficient events per predictor variable, 2) use multiple imputation models to address missing values, 3) use the continuous variant of the predictor if available and 4) incorporate all different types of readily available predictors (i.e., physiological variables, anatomical variables, injury cause/mechanism, and demographic variables). Furthermore, while mortality rates are decreasing, it is important to develop models that predict physical, cognitive status, or quality of life to measure quality of care.}},

abstract = {{Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant infection prevention and control challenge. The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem. Methods We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimising hospital acquired COVID-19 particularly to patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission. Results 93 patients were evaluated with 79 (85\%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. 28 (30\%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C \& D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients. Discussion Application of a clinical triage tool to guide isolation and cohorting decisions may reduce the risk of hospital acquired transmission of COVID-19 especially to individuals at the greatest of risk of severe disease. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement No external funding \#\#\# Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

abstract = {{Public health service is organized in such a manner so as to ensure all the inhabitants of the Republic of Slovenia the emergency medical assistance available at all times, including emergency transport and provision of emergency medicinal products as soon as possible and as close to the date of their manufacture as possible and during transport. Emergency medical assistance means the implementation of necessary measures by doctors and their teams with persons whose life is imminently threatened due to illness or injury and persons, respectively, who could be affected by such a risk in a short period of time according to the symptoms. Emergency calls are received and processed by the emergency medical assistance service which forms an integral part of the public health service network. Emergency patients with life-threatening trauma or disease are treated by prehospital emergency physicians at the scene and during transport. Emergency patients are guaranteed to be reached by an appropriate emergency vehicle and a respective crew within 10 minutes in 80\% of the responses and within 15 minutes in 95\% of cases. In Slovenia was established 30 years ago the so-called Franco-German system, with a highly developed pre-hospital emergency physician service and interdisciplinary hospital-based emergency medicine on different departments (trauma center, department for internal intensiv medicine, department of ananstesiology, department for neurology and pediatrics department (1). This gap is now closing fast because of the rapid advancement of hospital-based emergency medicine in Slovenia. In-hospital emergency medicine has been reorganized in many hospitals during the last few years. Economic and quality arguments have initiated the development of departments for emergency medicine in Slovenia. In the future, this will lead to new qualification criteria for physicians working in these departments. Four specific recommendations for development and organizations emergency medicine are required: the recognition as a specialty, the specialist training programme, the professional organization of emergency physicians and the presence of academic emergency centres (2). Slovenia is one of the 11 European countries who recognize hospital-based emergency medicine as a specialty (3, 4). This is 5-year specialty training (based on European curriculum) and the curriculum follows a symptom-oriented approach to emergency medicine, and includes a skilled description of the key competencies of the future trained emergency physicians (4). Slovenia has very well organised prehospital on-physician based emergency service and new qualification criteria for those physicians in emergency departments, therefore, need to be developed with primary education trainers for emergency medicine. In the model of integration of prehospital and hospital emergency medicine in academic emergency centers, emergency physicians work equal in ED and in the field on the method of rotation without changes of actual prehospital on-physicians based EMS.The integrative model have one in-door for emergency patients, mobility ofprehospital emergency physicians, a nurse-driven triage system and support of primary care physicians as gatekeepers.}},

abstract = {{Clinical research is increasingly ‘offshored’ to developing countries, a practice that has generated considerable controversy. It has recently been argued that the prevailing ethical norms governing such research are deeply puzzling. On the one hand, sponsors are not required to offshore trials, even when participants in developing countries would benefit considerably from these trials. On the other hand, if sponsors do offshore, they are required not to exploit participants, even when the latter would benefit from and consent to exploitation. How, it is asked, can it be worse to exploit the global poor than to neglect them when exploitation is voluntary and makes them better off? The present article seeks to respond to this challenge. I argue that mutually beneficial and voluntary exploitation can be worse than neglect when — as is typically true of exploitative international research — it takes advantage of unjust background conditions. This is because, in such cases, exploitation overlaps with another, less familiar wrong: complicity in injustice. Recognising complicity as a distinct wrong should make us judge exchanges arising from background injustice more harshly than we typically do, in research and elsewhere.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:Burnout is a state of mental and physical exhaustion related to work or care giving activities. Burnout during residency training has gained significant attention secondary to concerns regarding job performance and patient care. This article reviews the relevant literature on burnout in order to provide information to educators about its prevalence, features, impact, and potential interventions.
METHODS:Studies were identified through a Medline and PsychInfo search from 1974 to 2009. Fifty-one studies were identified. Definition and description of burnout and measurement methods are presented followed by a thorough review of the studies.

RESULTS:An examination of the burnout literature reveals that it is prevalent in medical students (28\%-45\%), residents (27\%-75\%, depending on specialty), as well as practicing physicians. Psychological distress and physical symptoms can impact work performance and patient safety. Distress during medical school can lead to burnout, which in turn can result in negative consequences as a working physician. Burnout also poses significant challenges during early training years in residency. Time demands, lack of control, work planning, work organization, inherently difficult job situations, and interpersonal relationships, are considered factors contributing to residents' burnout. Potential interventions include workplace-driven and individual-driven measures. Workplace interventions include education about burnout, workload modifications, increasing the diversity of work duties, stress management training, mentoring, emotional intelligence training, and wellness workshops. Individual-driven behavioral, social, and physical activities include promoting interpersonal professional relations, meditation, counseling, and exercise.

CONCLUSIONS:Educators need to develop an active awareness of burnout and ought to consider incorporating relevant instruction and interventions during the process of training resident physicians.}},

abstract = {{<h2>Summary</h2><p>The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90\%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9\% and 11\% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3–4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.</p>}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:Ideally, clinical prediction models are generalizable to other patient groups. Unfortunately, they perform regularly worse when validated in new patients and are then often redeveloped. While the original prediction model usually has been developed on a large data set, redevelopment then often occurs on the smaller validation set. Recently, methods to update existing prediction models with the data of new patients have been proposed. We used an existing model that preoperatively predicts the risk of severe postoperative pain (SPP) to compare five updating methods.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:The model was tested and updated with a set of 752 new patients (274 [36] with SPP). We studied the discrimination (ability to distinguish between patients with and without SPP) and calibration (agreement between the predicted risks and observed frequencies of SPP) of the five updated models in 283 other patients (100 [35\%] with SPP).

RESULTS:Simple recalibration methods improved the calibration to a similar extent as revision methods that made more extensive adjustments to the original model. Discrimination could not be improved by any of the methods.

CONCLUSION:When the performance is poor in new patients, updating methods can be applied to adjust the model, rather than to develop a new model.}},

RESULTS:Health professionals involved in burns treatment or rehabilitation at seven hospitals from four states in India were invited to participate in consultative meetings. Existing treatment and rehabilitation strategies, barriers and enablers to patient flow across the continuum of care and details on inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation were discussed during the meetings. Seventeen health professionals from various clinical backgrounds were involved in the consultation process. Key themes highlighted (a) a lack of awareness on burn first aid at the community level, (b) a lack of human resource to treat burn injuries in hospital settings, (c) a gap in burn care training for medical staff, (d) poor hospital infrastructure and (e) a variation in treatment practices and rehabilitation services available between hospitals. A number of opportunities exist to improve burns treatment and rehabilitation in India. Improvements would most effectively be achieved through promoting multidisciplinary care across a number of facilities and service providers. Further research is required to develop context-specific burn care models, determining how these can be integrated into the Indian healthcare system.}},

The eight ethical areas we discuss include the nature of intervention, types of research subjects, units of intervention and observation, informed consent, controls and comparisons, risk assessment, inclusion of vulnerable groups, and benefits of research. HSR involving human participants is necessary to ensure health systems strengthening and quality of care and to guide public policy intelligently. Health systems researchers must carefully define their intent and goals and openly clarify the values that may influence the premises and design of protocols. As new types of population-level research activities become more commonplace, it is critical that institutional review board (IRB) and research ethics committee (REC) review processes evolve to evaluate these research protocols in ways that address the nuanced features of these studies.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Physical activity interventions are more likely to be effective if they target causal determinants of behaviour change. Targeting requires accurate identification of specific theoretical determinants of physical activity. Two studies were undertaken to develop and validate the Determinants of Physical Activity Questionnaire.
METHODS:In Study 1, 832 male and female university staff and students were recruited from 49 universities across the UK and completed the 66-item measure, which is based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. Confirmatory factor analysis was undertaken on a calibration sample to generate the model, which resulted in a loss of 31 items. A validation sample was used to cross-validate the model. 20 new items were added and Study 2 tested the revised model in a sample of 466 male and female university students together with a physical activity measure.

RESULTS:The final model consisted of 11 factors and 34 items, and CFA produced a reasonable fit χ2 (472) = 852.3, p < .001, CFI = .933, SRMR = .105, RMSEA = .042 (CI = .037-.046), as well as generally acceptable levels of discriminant validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Eight subscales significantly differentiated between high and low exercisers, indicating that those who exercise less report more barriers for physical activity.

CONCLUSIONS:A theoretically underpinned measure of determinants of physical activity has been developed with reasonable reliability and validity. Further work is required to test the measure amongst a more representative sample. This study provides an innovative approach to identifying potential barriers to physical activity. This approach illustrates a method for moving from diagnosing implementation difficulties to designing and evaluating interventions.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Our previous Delphi study identified several audit filters considered sensitive to deviations in prehospital trauma care and potentially useful in conducting performance improvement, a process currently recommended by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. This study validates 2 of those proposed audit filters.
STUDY DESIGN:We studied 4,744 trauma patients using the electronic records of the Central Region Trauma registry and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) patient logs for the period January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2004. We studied whether requests by on-scene Basic Life Support (BLS) for Advanced Life Support (ALS) assistance or failure by EMS personnel to record basic patient physiology at the scene was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. We performed multivariate analyses, including a propensity score quintile approach, adjusting for differences in case mix and clustering by hospital.

RESULTS:Overall mortality was 6.1\%. A total of 28.2\% (n = 1,337) of EMS records were missing patient scene physiologic data. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients missing 1 or more measures of patient physiology at the scene had increased risk of death (adjusted odds ratio = 2.15; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 4.10). In 17.4\% (n = 402) of cases BLS requested ALS assistance. Patients for whom BLS requested ALS had a similar risk of death as patients for whom ALS was initially dispatched (odds ratio = 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.51 to 2.15).

CONCLUSIONS:Failure of EMS to document basic measures of scene physiology is associated with increased mortality. This deviation in care can serve as a sensitive audit filter for performance improvement. The need by BLS for ALS assistance was not associated with increased mortality.}},

We interviewed physicians from six hospitals in the greater Montreal, Canada area, in order to understand the emergency room scheduling problem. Extracting the real scheduling problem is difficult because physician working conditions are based on informal mutual cooperation which is usually not documented. We present the characteristics of the scheduling problem and the scheduling techniques currently used in the six emergency rooms we analyzed. Using the scheduling problems of Charles-Lemoyne Hospital and the Jewish General Hospital, we show how to modify a hospital's existing scheduling rules to develop techniques which produce better schedules and reduce the time needed to build them.}},

We examined the association of acid-base blood values (pH) with patient outcomes and calculated the pH test performance to predict prognosis. Methods This was a post-hoc analysis of data from the continuous chest compression trial, which enrolled non-traumatic adult emergency medical system-treated OHCA in Canada and the United States. We examined cases who survived a minimum of 24 h post hospital arrival. The independent variables of interest were initial pH, final pH, and the change in pH (δpH). The primary outcome was neurological status at hospital discharge, with favorable status defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 3. We reported adjusted odds ratios for favorable neurological outcome using multivariable logistic regression models. We calculated the test performance of increasing pH thresholds in 0.1 increments to predict unfavorable neurological status (defined as mRS >3) at hospital discharge. Results We included 4189 patients. 32\% survived to hospital discharge with favorable neurological status. In the adjusted analysis, higher initial pH (OR 6.82; 95\% CI 3.71–12.52) and higher final pH (OR 7.99; 95\% CI 3.26−19.62) were associated with higher odds of favorable neurological status. pH thresholds with highest positive predictive values were initial pH < 6.8 (92.5\%; 95\% CI 86.2 \%–98.8\%) and final pH < 7.0 (100\%; 95\% CI 95.2 \%–100\%). Conclusion In patients with OHCA, pH values were associated with patients’ subsequent neurological status at hospital discharge. Final pH may be clinically useful to predict unfavorable neurological status at hospital discharge.}},

The Brier score has been recommended on the grounds that it is a proper scoring rule that is affected by both discrimination and calibration. However, the Brier score is prevalence dependent in such a way that the rank ordering of tests or models may inappropriately vary by prevalence. We explored four common clinical scenarios: comparison of a highly accurate binary test with a continuous prediction model of moderate predictiveness; comparison of two binary tests where the importance of sensitivity versus specificity is inversely associated with prevalence; comparison of models and tests to default strategies of assuming that all or no patients are positive; and comparison of two models with miscalibration in opposite directions. In each case, we found that the Brier score gave an inappropriate rank ordering of the tests and models. Conversely, net benefit, a decision-analytic measure, gave results that always favored the preferable test or model. Brier score does not evaluate clinical value of diagnostic tests or prediction models. We advocate, as an alternative, the use of decision-analytic measures such as net benefit. Not applicable.}},

This poses a challenge for early detection during triage in the emergency department (ED). Over a 3‐month period, our ED aimed to minimize nosocomial transmission by using broader suspect case criteria for better detection and using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers (HCWs). All ED admissions with respiratory syndromes over a 3‐month period were tested for COVID‐19. The sensitivity and specificity of screening criteria in detecting COVID‐19 were assessed. A risk‐stratified approach was adopted for PPE usage in the ED, based on high‐risk “fever areas” and lower‐risk zones. When a case of COVID‐19 was confirmed, surveillance was conducted for potentially exposed patients and HCWs. A total of 1,841 cases presenting with respiratory syndromes required admission over the study period. Among these, 70 cases of COVID‐19 were subsequently confirmed. The majority (84.2\%, 59/70) were detected at ED triage because they fulfilled suspect case criteria. Of these, 34 met the official screening criteria; an additional 25 were detected by the broader internal screening criteria. Over the 12‐week period, the cumulative sensitivity of internal screening criteria was 84.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 73.6\% to 91.9\%), whereas the sensitivity of the official screening criteria was 48.6\% (95\% CI = 36.4\% to 60.8\%). Given the broadened internal criteria, the preexisting ED “fever area” was insufficient and had to be expanded. However, there were no cases of nosocomial transmission from intra‐ED exposure, despite extensive surveillance. Frontline physicians need to be given leeway to decide on the disposition of cases based on clinical suspicion during an ongoing outbreak of COVID‐19. If a broader criterion is used at ED triage, ED facilities and isolation facilities need to be readied to accommodate a surge of suspect cases. Usage of appropriate PPE is essential in minimizing nosocomial transmission.}},

It presents an overview of methodologic issues in qualitative research with reference to three major qualitative research traditions: ethnography (and ethnographic interviewing), participant observation, and focus groups. Participant observation is commonly used by anthropologists to study a culture in depth. Ethnographic interviews can be nested in participant observation activities but are always conducted in the subject's community setting. Focus groups provide a relatively efficient method to elicit beliefs and attitude from multiple individuals simultaneously. The chapter discusses sampling, data collection, and measures to ensure reliability and validity of qualitative studies. The validity of findings can also be enhanced when the researcher shares the interpretation of data with subjects from the study. Qualitative research methods can be effectively combined with quantitative methods to both derive and test hypotheses regarding human aspects of injury control.}},

To systematically examine the application of the Delphi technique for the development of best practice guidelines in palliative care. A methodological systematic review was undertaken using the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete and EMBASE. Original articles (English language) were included when reporting on empirical studies that had used the Delphi technique to develop guidance for good clinical practice in palliative care. Data extraction included a quality appraisal on the rigour in conduct of the studies and the quality of reporting. A total of 30 empirical studies (1997–2015) were considered for full-text analysis. Considerable differences were identified regarding the rigour of the design and the reporting of essential process and outcome parameters. Furthermore, discrepancies regarding the use of terms for describing the method were observed, for example, concerning the understanding of a ‘round’ or a ‘modified Delphi study’. Substantial variation was found concerning the quality of the study conduct and the transparency of reporting of Delphi studies used for the development of best practice guidance in palliative care. Since credibility of the resulting recommendations depends on the rigorous use of the Delphi technique, there is a need for consistency and quality both in the conduct and reporting of studies. To allow a critical appraisal of the methodology and the resulting guidance, a reporting standard for Conducting and REporting of DElphi Studies (CREDES) is proposed.}},

Assessing the health profiles of populations is a crucial task to create a coherent healthcare offer. Emergency Departments (EDs) are at the core of the healthcare system and could benefit from this evaluation via an improved understanding of the healthcare needs of their population. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm based on multimorbidity analysis. The proposed approach constructs the clustering dendrogram by introducing new quality indicators based on the relative risk of co-occurrences of patient diagnoses. This algorithm enables the detection of multimorbidity patterns by merging similar patient profiles according to their common diagnoses. The multimorbidity approach has been applied to the data of the largest ED of the Aube Department (Eastern France) to cluster its patient visits. Among the 120,718 visits identified during a 24-month period, 16 clusters were identified, accounting for 94.8\% of the visits, with the five most prevalent clusters representing 63.0\% of them. The new quality indicators show a coherent and good clustering solution with a cluster membership of 1.81 based on a cluster compactness of 1.40 and a cluster separation of 0.77. Compared to the literature, the proposed approach is appropriate for the discovery of multimorbidity patterns and could help to develop better clustering algorithms for more diverse healthcare datasets.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Trauma is the leading cause of death among Mongolians aged 24-44. To improve initial management of injured patients, the Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences (MNUMS) implemented the American College of Surgeons' (ACS) Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) training program in 2015. Cost analysis demonstrates that such programs can have clear pathways to self-sufficiency.
METHODS:Costs associated with an ACS Mongolian ATLS program were quantified based on discussions with the Mongolian government, MNUMS, ATLS Australasia headquarters, and existing pricing data. Costs were then classified as either essential or contingencies. These classifications determined budgetary items for each program. Savings projections for contingencies included training Mongolian instructors and educators. Scenarios for funding the budget were then assessed.

RESULTS:The minimum annual cost of ATLS in Mongolia, which includes 3 ATLS student courses/1 instructor course, is \$10,709. A budget of \$19,900 includes additional contingencies. The scenario that involves foreign instructors is the most expensive one. An initial investment of \$85,000 to train Mongolian instructors reduces annual costs by \$48,305 (71\% reduction). An investment of \$4050 to train a Mongolian educator will reduce costs by \$1750 annually. ATLS can be sustained with 0.04\% of Mongolia's current spending on public health and preventative services.

CONCLUSIONS:Initial investment to train Mongolian ATLS instructors leads to substantial savings. Training a Mongolian educator lowers long-term costs. When minimum costs for ATLS courses are understood, these can be scaled up and supported with different contingencies and minimal funding by government or third-party stakeholders.}},

METHODS:Data were drawn from the Web-based Injury Query System, which contains US injury mortality data from 1981 to 2007. Male-to-female rate ratios in injury mortality are calculated for key variables, and age and ethnic group comparisons are made.

RESULTS:Boys and men were more likely than girls and women to die of injury. From 1981 to 2007, the male-to-female age-adjusted rate ratio decreased by 20\% to 2.15 for unintentional injury and increased by 11\% to 3.91 for violence-related injury. Excess male mortality existed in manner of death, cause of death, and within ethnic and age groups. Additionally, with rare exception, the gender disparity was greater than ethnic and age disparities in unintentional and violence-related injury mortality.

CONCLUSIONS:Gender disparities in injury mortality are consistent and persistent. Gender patterns in injury mortality do not follow typical social justice analyses of health, in that men are at greater risk. Lifestyle and behavioral risks as well as masculine socialization merit consideration.}},

A systematic search of relevant databases, using MeSH descriptors ED/EDs, Emergency room/s, ER/s, or A\&E coupled with (and) working environment, working condition/s, staff perception/s, as well as reference chaining was conducted. We identified 31 key studies that were evaluated using the mixed methods assessment tool (MMAT). These comprised 24 quantitative-descriptive studies, four mixed descriptive/comparative (non-randomised controlled trial) studies and three qualitative studies. Studies included varied widely in quality with MMAT scores ranging from 0\% to 100\%. A key finding was that perceptions of working environment varied across clinical staff and study location, but that high levels of autonomy and teamwork offset stress around high pressure and high volume workloads. The large range of tools used to assess staff perception of working environment limits the comparability of the studies. A dearth of intervention studies around enhancing working environments in EDs limits the capacity to recommend evidence-based interventions to improve staff morale.}},

abstract = {{Background: Despite the growing interest in the development of emergency care systems and emergency medicine (EM) as a specialty globally, there still exists a significant gap between the need for and the provision of emergency care by specialty trained providers. Many efforts to date to expand the practice of EM have focused on programs developed through partnerships between higher- and lower-resource settings.Objective: To systematically review the literature to evaluate the composition of EM training programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) developed through partnerships.Methods: An electronic search was conducted using four databases for manuscripts on EM training programs – defined as structured education and/or training in the methods, procedures, and techniques of acute or emergency care – developed through partnerships. The search produced 7702 results. Using a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria, 94 manuscripts were included. After scoring these manuscripts, a more in-depth examination of 26 of the high-scoring manuscripts was conducted.Findings: Fifteen highlight programs with a focus on specific EM content (i.e. ultrasound) and 11 cover EM programs with broader scopes. All outline programs with diverse curricula and varied educational and evaluative methods spanning from short courses to full residency programs, and they target learners from medical students and nurses to mid-level providers and physicians. Challenges of EM program development through partnerships include local adaptation of international materials; addressing the local culture(s) of learning, assessment, and practice; evaluation of impact; sustainability; and funding.Conclusions: Overall, this review describes a diverse group of programs that have been or are currently being implemented through partnerships. Additionally, it highlights several areas for program development, including addressing other topic areas within EM beyond trauma and ultrasound and evaluating outcomes beyond the level of the learner. These steps to develop effective programs will further the advancement of EM as a specialty and enhance the development of effective emergency care systems globally.}},

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:Over 90\% of injury-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Relating spatial distribution of injury burden and trauma care capacity is crucial for effective resource allocation. Our study assesses trauma burden and emergency and essential surgical care (EESC) quality in Teso Sub-region Eastern Uganda through a spatial analysis of trauma burden in relation to surgical capacity at the district level.
METHODS:In this study, we surveyed trauma patients presenting at Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) and assessed EESC capacity of district hospitals. We used geospatial techniques to relate trauma burden and capacity and characterized delay using the three-delay framework.

RESULTS:We surveyed 131 trauma patients presenting to SRRH for trauma-related injuries from June 1 to July 15, 2017. Almost all trauma incidents (n = 129, 98.4\%) occurred within a 2-h ideal drive time to SRRH. From time of injury to receiving care, median time totaled to approximately 9.25 h. District hospital exhibited decreased EESC capacity (personnel, infrastructure, procedures, equipment, and supplies (PIPES) score range 2.2-5.5, mean 4.2) compared to SRRH (PIPES score 8.1).

CONCLUSION:Trauma patients face delays in each step of the care-seeking process from deciding to seek care, arriving at care site, and receiving treatment. Synergistic effects of a poor prehospital care, EESC deficiencies on district and regional levels, cost of seeking care contribute to delays that likely result in increased morbidity and mortality. Improved resource allocation, training at the district level, and strengthening system-level organization of emergency medical services could avert preventable death and disability.}},

After a broad search of PubMed and websites of organizations publishing relevant gray literature, all articles that were deemed relevant to the fields of disaster and humanitarian response, emergency care in resource‐limited settings, and EM development by at least one reviewer, an editor, and the managing editors were then scored by two different reviewers using a 20‐point scoring template relevant to either original research (OR) or review (RE) articles. This scoring system rates articles on their clarity, research design, ethics, importance to global EM, and breadth of impact. Articles that then scored in the top 5\% were then critiqued in depth. A total of 23,321 article titles and abstracts were screened by 22 reviewers with a wide swath of clinical and research experience in global EM. From these, a total of 356 articles underwent full‐text review and scoring on the 20‐point scale; 26\% were categorized as disaster and humanitarian response, 58\% as emergency care in resource‐limited settings, and 15\% as EM development. Of these 356 articles, 276 (77.5\%) were OR articles and 80 (22.5\%) were RE articles. The 16 articles that scored in the top 5\% (>17.5 of 20 points) received full in‐depth narrative summaries. In 2019, the overall number of studies relevant to global EM that were identified by our search decreased from the prior year, but more high‐scoring articles related to the development of EM clinical practice and as a specialty in resource‐constrained settings were identified.}},

Design Retrospective, case control study. Materials and Methods Data for 21,175 patients submitted during 1992 to the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS) were analyzed. Patients qualifying by each 1990 ACS audit filter were identified, except filters 13 and 22 that were not accommodated by the PTOS form. In addition, qualifiers by filter 21 (trauma deaths) were not analyzed. For each qualifier by a filter, matching patients who were not qualifiers by the filter were identified. Matching patients had the same cause of injury, A Severity Characterization of Trauma (ASCOT) age category, distribution of serious (Abbreviated Injury Score of >2) injuries, intubation status, and coded Revised Trauma Score values on Emergency Department arrival. Qualifiers and matching patients were compared for their survival (z and W statistics), discharge disability (PTOS-Functional Independence Measure), and lengths of stay in the hospital (H-LOS) and in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU-LOS). Measurements and Main Results More than 57\% of the study sample qualified by one or more filters. Filters 10 and 12 did not have sufficient qualifiers for evaluation. No filter's qualifiers were associated with significantly more disability at discharge than matching patients. The most frequently occurring filters (4, 2, and 5, respec-tively) deal with documentation deficiencies, but were not associated with significant results. Qualifiers by the nine filters below were associated with significantly greater mortality or H-LOS or ICU-LOS. (see Table 7) Conclusions Additional studies of the efficacy and efficiency of trauma quality assurance filters are needed. Objective criteria should be established for the definition, evaluation, modification, and adoption of trauma audit filters.}},

However, as exposed by indirect consequences of poorly adapted COVID-19 guidelines, fundamental gaps continue to be reported between international recommendations and realistic best practice. To address this long-standing injustice of leaving health providers without useful guidance, we draw on examples from maternal health and the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a framework for how global guideline developers can more effectively stratify recommendations for low-resource settings and account for predictable contextual barriers of implementation (eg, human resources) as well as gains and losses (eg, cost-efficiency). Such development of more realistic clinical practice guidelines at the global level will pave the way for simpler and achievable adaptation at local levels. We also urge the development and adaptation of high-quality clinical practice guidelines at national and subnational levels in low-income and middle-income countries through co-creation with end-users, and we encourage global sharing of these experiences.}},

Scoring systems based upon the anatomic injury are an important method of measuring injury severity and are critical to injury epidemiology, injury prevention, trauma system development and outcome analysis. In addition to the information captured by scales of anatomic injury severity, measures of the physiologic response to injury such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), and level of consciousness are also important indicators of the severity of an injury. By combining measures of the severity of anatomic injury with those of acute physiologic derangement and age, it has been possible to provide statistically strong estimates of survival probability following trauma. Finally, the chapter also reviews the measures of co-morbidity, the term used to describe health status factors likely to influence the outcome after injury.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma has created a "Trauma Quality Improvement Program" (TQIP) that uses the existing infrastructure of Committee on Trauma programs. As the first step toward full implementation of TQIP, a pilot study was conducted in 23 American College of Surgeons verified or state designated Level I and II trauma centers. This study details the feasibility and acceptance of TQIP among the participating centers.
METHODS:Data from the National Trauma Data Bank for patients admitted to pilot study hospitals during 2007 were used (15,801 patients). A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to estimate risk-adjusted mortality in aggregate and on three prespecified subgroups (1: blunt multisystem, 2: penetrating truncal, and 3: blunt single-system injury). Benchmark reports were developed with each center's risk adjusted mortality (expressed as an observed-to-expected [O/E] mortality ratio and 90\% confidence interval [CI]) and crude complication rates available for comparison. Reports were deidentified with only the recipient having access to their performance relative to their peers. Feedback from individual centers regarding the utility of the reports was collected by survey.

RESULTS:Overall crude mortality was 7.7\% and in cohorts 1 to 3 was 16.4\%, 12.4\%, and 5.1\%, respectively. In the aggregate risk-adjusted analysis, three trauma centers were low outliers (O/E and 90\% CI <1) and two centers were high outliers (O/E and 90\% CI >1) with the remaining 18 centers demonstrating average mortality. Challenges identified were in benchmarking mortality after penetrating injury due to small sample size and in the limited capture of complications. Ninety-two percent of survey respondents found the report clear and understandable, and 90\% thought that the report was useful. Sixty-three percent of respondents will be taking action based on the report.

CONCLUSIONS:Using the National Trauma Data Bank infrastructure to provide risk-adjusted benchmarking of trauma center mortality is feasible and perceived as useful. There are differences in O/E ratios across similarly verified or designated centers. Substantial work is required to allow for morbidity benchmarking.}},

However, gender differences in trauma outcomes in different countries have not been previously compared. We conducted a two-country comparative analysis to characterise gender differences in mortality for different mechanisms of injury. Two urban trauma databases were analysed from India and the USA for fall, motor vehicle collision (MVC) and assault patients between 2013 and 2015. Coarsened exact matching was used to match the two groups based on gender, age, injury severity score, Glasgow Coma Score and type of injury (blunt vs penetrating). The primary outcome of mortality was studied by using logistic regression to calculate the odds of death in the four country/gender subgroups. A total of 10 089 and 14 144 patients were included from the Indian and US databases, respectively. After matching on covariates, 7505 and 9448 patients were included in the logistic regression. Indian males had the highest odds of death compared with US males, US females and Indian females for falls, MVC and assaults. Indian females had over 7 times the odds of dying after falls, 5 times the odds of dying for MVC and 40 times the odds of dying after assaults when compared with US females. The high odds of death for Indian females compared with US females suggests that there are other injury and systemic factors that contribute to this discrepancy in mortality odds. This same mortality pattern and implication is seen for Indian males compared with all subgroups. Standardised coding of injury mechanism in trauma registries, in addition to intentionality of injury, can help further characterise discrepancies in outcomes by gender and country, to guide targeted injury prevention and care.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Quality improvement (QI) programs have shown to reduce preventable mortality in trauma care. Detailed review of all trauma deaths is a time and resource consuming process and calculated probability of survival (Ps) has been proposed as audit filter. Review is limited on deaths that were 'expected to survive'. However no Ps-based algorithm has been validated and no study has examined elements of preventability associated with deaths classified as 'expected'. The objective of this study was to examine whether trauma performance review can be streamlined using existing mortality prediction tools without missing important areas for improvement.
METHODS:We conducted a retrospective study of all trauma deaths reviewed by our trauma QI program. Deaths were classified into non-preventable, possibly preventable, probably preventable or preventable. Opportunities for improvement (OPIs) involve failure in the process of care and were classified into clinical and system deviations from standards of care. TRISS and PS were used for calculation of probability of survival. Peer-review charts were reviewed by a single investigator.

RESULTS:Over 8 years, 626 patients were included. One third showed elements of preventability and 4\% were preventable. Preventability occurred across the entire range of the calculated Ps band. Limiting review to unexpected deaths would have missed over 50\% of all preventability issues and a third of preventable deaths. 37\% of patients showed opportunities for improvement (OPIs). Neither TRISS nor PS allowed for reliable identification of OPIs and limiting peer-review to patients with unexpected deaths would have missed close to 60\% of all issues in care.

CONCLUSIONS:TRISS and PS fail to identify a significant proportion of avoidable deaths and miss important opportunities for process and system improvement. Based on this, all trauma deaths should be subjected to expert panel review in order to aim at a maximal output of performance improvement programs.}},

While segmented regression is a common approach, it is not always adequate, especially in the presence of seasonality and autocorrelation. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is an alternative method that can accommodate these issues. We describe the underlying theory behind ARIMA models and how they can be used to evaluate population-level interventions, such as the introduction of health policies. We discuss how to select the shape of the impact, the model selection process, transfer functions, checking model fit, and interpretation of findings. We also provide R and SAS code to replicate our results. We illustrate ARIMA modelling using the example of a policy intervention to reduce inappropriate prescribing. In January 2014, the Australian government eliminated prescription refills for the 25 mg tablet strength of quetiapine, an antipsychotic, to deter its prescribing for non-approved indications. We examine the impact of this policy intervention on dispensing of quetiapine using dispensing claims data. ARIMA modelling is a useful tool to evaluate the impact of large-scale interventions when other approaches are not suitable, as it can account for underlying trends, autocorrelation and seasonality and allows for flexible modelling of different types of impacts.}},

We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ≥0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of ≤ 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R2, and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox‐Snell R2, which we show can be obtained from previous studies. The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.}},

Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic \&lsqb;ROC\&rsqb; curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration. Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions. We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n \&equals; 544 for model development, n \&equals; 273 for external validation). We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.}},

However, GAM assumes that errors are mutually independent, while time series can be correlated in adjacent time points. Here, a GAM with Autoregressive terms (GAMAR) is introduced to fill this gap. Parameters in GAMAR are estimated by maximum partial likelihood using modified Newton’s method, and the difference between GAM and GAMAR is demonstrated using two simulation studies and a real data example. GAMM is also compared to GAMAR in simulation study 1. In the simulation studies, the bias of the mean estimates from GAM and GAMAR are similar but GAMAR has better coverage and smaller relative error. While the results from GAMM are similar to GAMAR, the estimation procedure of GAMM is much slower than GAMAR. In the case study, the Pearson residuals from the GAM are correlated, while those from GAMAR are quite close to white noise. In addition, the estimates of the temperature effects are different between GAM and GAMAR. GAMAR incorporates both explanatory variables and AR terms so it can quantify the nonlinear impact of environmental factors on health outcome as well as the serial correlation between the observations. It can be a useful tool in environmental epidemiological studies.}},

METHODS:The protocol was registered a priori (CRD42017058586). With librarian oversight, a peer-reviewed search strategy was developed. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, two independent reviewers performed first-screen and full-text screening. Studies describing implementation of a TR in LMICs or reviewed the experience of registry users/implementers were included. Extracted data, focusing on publication, institution, registry and data factors, was summarized using descriptive statistics and subjected to thematic qualitative analysis.

RESULTS:Out of 3842 screened references, 40 articles were included for analysis. Most registries were paper-based, implemented in single publicly-funded institutions within LMICs, benefited from funding, and were run by untrained house-staff with other clinical responsibilities. Constituent variables, injury scoring, outcome assessment, and quality assurance practices were very diverse. Principal obstacles to successful implementation were lack of funding, significant missing data, and insufficient resources.

CONCLUSIONS:This work may contribute to the planning of future efforts towards TR implementation in LMICs, where better injury data has the potential to alleviate the morbidity and mortality associated with trauma through advocacy and quality-improvement.}},

This chapter provides an overview of the benefits and limitations of use of these electronic databases, categories of uses, types of databases that have been employed in injury research, and some of the methods used. A use of secondary data is the linkage of two or more different databases resulting in a new, enriched, database. Issues that must be dealt with, in addition to those of privacy/confidentiality of information, may include the lack of a unique identifier across all databases, handling of diverse file formats, and the final ownership of the linked product. The level of time and effort required to conduct data linkages depends on the amount and type of information available to conduct a linkage, but always seems to be underestimated in the planning stages of a project.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma devised process audit filters to identify opportunities for improvement (OFI), prevent adverse outcomes, and improve quality. Delay to the operating room for primary trauma laparotomy is a process audit filter that has not been definitively associated with improved outcomes. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of delay to the operating room of greater than 2 hours (DOR) to independently identify an adverse outcome or an OFI at our Level I trauma center.
METHODS:Trauma patients who underwent primary exploratory laparotomy from July 2006 to March 2015 were reviewed. Those with DOR were identified and compared with those without DOR. To analyze the ability of DOR to independently identify an adverse outcome or an OFI, DOR patients were further divided into those with isolated DOR and those with DOR in conjunction with one or more other process audit filter. Primary outcome was the presence of a complication. Secondary outcome was an identified OFI. Medical records of patients with either outcome were reviewed to determine if the outcome resulted directly from DOR.

RESULTS:Of 472 patients, 109 (23\%) had DOR and 363 (77\%) did not. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or injury severity between the two groups. The rates of complications among DOR patients and those without DOR were not significantly different (35\% vs. 38\%, p = 0.59). The DOR was the only process audit filter flagged in 31(28\%) patients in the DOR group. This subgroup had no identified complications but incurred two OFIs; neither OFI was associated with an adverse outcome.

CONCLUSION:In trauma patients undergoing primary exploratory laparotomy, DOR fails to independently identify adverse outcomes. These findings suggest that DOR, as a routinely collected process audit filter, is not an effective indicator of suboptimal care or adverse outcomes at a Level I trauma center.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:This is the first study to consider feedback on the specialty of emergency medicine (EM) given by other hospital specialties. Method: A questionnaire was sent to 100 randomly selected consultants and specialist registrars from other specialties in a district general hospital in Northern England. The response rate was 67\%.
RESULTS:80\% of respondents felt that the official term for the specialty should be "accident and emergency medicine". Resuscitation and major trauma were given the highest importance scores (>9/10) when evaluating the purpose of EM and minor injuries were given an intermediate importance score (6.5/10). Respondents advocated "rapid rule out" of acute medical problems by the emergency department (75\%) and "any trained individual" carrying out ultrasound (72\%) or stroke thrombolysis (59\%) in the emergency department. Rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia exclusively by emergency physicians was unpopular (3\%). Respondents were least satisfied with the study department's documentation, availability of senior staff 24 h/day and the availability of equipment and drugs. Polyclinics and closure of smaller emergency department were unpopular future proposals, while 70\% advocated a revival of traditional out-of-hours general practice services.

CONCLUSION:The perceived purpose, strengths and weaknesses of EM provide a focus for training and development, while opinion on new practices indicates areas where resistance to change may be met. The results can contribute to decision-making for emergency departments and for EM as it strives to adapt to its role in the modern NHS. Further similar studies are planned on a wider scale.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:To study the emergency care effect of in-hospital severe trauma patients with the injury severity score (ISS) larger than or equal to 16 after medical staff received advanced trauma life support (ATLS) training.
METHODS:ATLS training was implemented by lectures, scenarios, field practices, and examinations. The clinical effect of in-hospital severe trauma care was compared 2 years before and after ATLS training.

RESULTS:During 2 years (from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2005) before ATLS training, 438 cases of severe trauma were admitted and treated emergently in our department. Among them, ISS score was 28.6+/-7.8 on average, and 87 cases died with the mortality of 19.9\%. The duration in emergency department and from admission to operation were 69.5 min+/-11.5 min and 89.6 min+/-9.3 min respectively. Two years (from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2008) after ATLS training, 382 cases of severe trauma were admitted and treated. The ISS was 25.3+/-6.1 on average and 62 cases died with the mortality of 15.1\%. The duration in emergency department and from admission to operation were 47.8 min+/-10.7 min and 61.5 min+/-9.9 min respectively. The ISS score showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05), but the mortality, the duration in emergency department and from admission to operation were markedly decreased after ATLS training and showed significant difference between the two groups (P <0.05).

CONCLUSION:ATLS course training can improve the emergency care effect of in-hospital severe trauma patients, and should be put into practice as soon as possible in China.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Trauma systems currently rely on imperfect and subjective tools to prioritize responses and resources, thus there is a critical need to develop a more accurate trauma severity score. Our objective was to modify the Rapid Emergency Medicine (REMS) Score for the trauma population and test its accuracy as a predictor of in-hospital mortality when compared to other currently used scores, including the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), the Injury Severity Score (ISS), the "Mechanism, Glasgow Coma Scale, Age and Arterial Pressure" (MGAP) score, and the Shock Index (SI) score.
METHODS:The two-part study design involved both a modification step and a validation step. The first step incorporated a retrospective analysis of a local trauma database (3680 patients) where three components of REMS were modified to more accurately represent the trauma population. Using clinical judgment and goodness-of-fit tests, systolic blood pressure was substituted for mean arterial pressure, the weighting of age was reduced, and the weighting of Glasgow Coma Scale was increased. The second part comprised validating the new modified REMS (mREMS) score retrospectively on a U.S. National Trauma Databank (NTDB) that included 429,711 patients admitted with trauma in 2012. The discriminate power of mREMS was compared to other trauma scores using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve.

RESULTS:Overall the mREMS score with an AUC of 0.967 (95\% CI: 0.963-0.971) was demonstrated to be higher than RTS (AUC 0.959 [95\% CI: 0.955-0.964]), ISS (AUC 0.780 [95\% CI 0.770-0.791]), MGAP (AUC 0.964 [95\% CI: 0.959-0.968]), and SI (AUC 0.670 [95\% CI: 0.650-0.690]) in predicting in-hospital mortality on the NTDB.

CONCLUSION:In the trauma population, mREMS is an accurate predictor of in-hospital mortality, outperforming other used scores. Simple and objective, mREMS may hold value in the pre-hospital and emergency department setting in order to guide trauma team responses.}},

Next, I focus on observations of outlier, leverage and influence that may have significant impact on model building. Outlier is such an observation that its response value is unusual conditional on covariate pattern. Leverage is an observation with covariate pattern that is far away from the regressor space. Influence is the product of outlier and leverage. That is, when influential observation is dropped from the model, there will be a significant shift of the coefficient. Summary statistics for outlier, leverage and influence are studentized residuals, hat values and Cook's distance.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide. Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95\%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95\%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95\%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95\%CI 0.929-1, P < 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on. CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement There is no funding received. \#\#\# Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:Trauma quality improvement (QI) programs have been shown to improve outcomes and decrease cost. These are high priorities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 2,000,000 deaths due to survivable injuries occur each year. We sought to define areas for improvement in trauma QI programs in four LMICs.
METHODS:We conducted a survey among trauma care providers in four Andean middle-income countries: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

RESULTS:336 physicians, medical students, nurses, administrators and paramedical professionals responded to the cross-sectional survey with a response rate greater than 90\% in all included countries except Bolivia, where the response rate was 14\%. Eighty-seven percent of respondents reported morbidity and mortality (M\&M) conferences occur at their hospital. Conferences were often reported as infrequent - 45\% occurred less than every three months and poorly attended - 63\% had five or fewer staff physicians present. Only 23\% of conferences had standardized selection criteria, most lacked documentation - notes were taken at only 35\% of conferences. Importantly, only 13\% of participants indicated that discussions were routinely followed-up with any sort of corrective action. Multivariable analysis revealed the presence of standardized case selection criteria (OR 3.48, 95\% CI 1.16-10.46), written documentation of the M\&M conferences (OR 5.73, 95\% CI 1.73-19.06), and a clear plan for follow-up (OR 4.80, 95\% CI 1.59-14.50) to be associated with effective M\&M conferences. Twenty-two percent of respondents worked at hospitals with a trauma registry. Fifty-two percent worked at institutions where autopsies were conducted, but only 32\% of those reported the autopsy results to ever be used to improve hospital practice.

CONCLUSIONS:M\&M conferences are frequently practiced in the Andean region of Latin America but often lack methodologic rigor and thus effectiveness. Next steps in the maturation of QI programs include optimizing use of data from autopsies and registries, and systematic follow-up of M\&M conferences with corrective action to ensure that these activities result in appreciable changes in clinical care.}},

abstract = {{Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is expected to significantly influence the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare in the near future. While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype and attention around the topic are significant. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful. For this, it is critical that physicians understand the basics of the technology so they can see beyond the hype, evaluate A.I.-based studies and clinical validation; as well as acknowledge the limitations and opportunities of A.I. This paper aims to serve as a short, visual and digestible repository of information and details every physician might need to know in the age of A.I. We describe the simple definition of A.I., its levels, its methods, the differences between the methods with medical examples, the potential benefits, dangers, challenges of A.I., as well as attempt to provide a futuristic vision about using it in an everyday medical practice.}},

abstract = {{This article shows how to apply generalized additive models and generalized additive mixed models to single-case design data. These models excel at detecting the functional form between two variables (often called trend), that is, whether trend exists, and if it does, what its shape is (e.g., linear and nonlinear). In many respects, however, these models are also an ideal vehicle for analyzing single-case designs because they can consider level, trend, variability, overlap, immediacy of effect, and phase consistency that single-case design researchers examine when interpreting a functional relation. We show how these models can be implemented in a wide variety of ways to test whether treatment is effective, whether cases differ from each other, whether treatment effects vary over cases, and whether trend varies over cases. We illustrate diagnostic statistics and graphs, and we discuss overdispersion of data in detail, with examples of quasibinomial models for overdispersed data, including how to compute dispersion and quasi-AIC fit indices in generalized additive models. We show how generalized additive mixed models can be used to estimate autoregressive models and random effects and discuss the limitations of the mixed models compared to generalized additive models. We provide extensive annotated syntax for doing all these analyses in the free computer program R.}},

This right is central to the creation of equitable health systems. We identify some of the right-to-health features of health systems, such as a comprehensive national health plan, and propose 72 indicators that reflect some of these features. We collect globally processed data on these indicators for 194 countries and national data for Ecuador, Mozambique, Peru, Romania, and Sweden. Globally processed data were not available for 18 indicators for any country, suggesting that organisations that obtain such data give insufficient attention to the right-to-health features of health systems. Where they are available, the indicators show where health systems need to be improved to better realise the right to health. We provide recommendations for governments, international bodies, civil-society organisations, and other institutions and suggest that these indicators and data, although not perfect, provide a basis for the monitoring of health systems and the progressive realisation of the right to health. Right-to-health features are not just good management, justice, or humanitarianism, they are obligations under human-rights law.}},

abstract = {{Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared global pandemic. There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization. A hindrance to this development is the vast amount of misinformation present due to scarcely sourced manuscript preprints and social media. This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments. The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice. Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated. Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19. These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment. Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated. Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified. Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described. Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed. The penultimate portion of the review aims to explain the involvement of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in COVID19 treatment and prophylaxis. Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented. Lastly, the current scientific data and status of governing bodies such as the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO on the usage of controversial therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen), and corticosteroids usage in COVID-19 are discussed. The composite collection of accredited studies on each of these subtopics of COVID-19 within this review will enable clarification and focus on the current status and direction in the planning of the management of this global pandemic.}},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS:Using a combination of prospective cohort and registry data from 3,728 patients of Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes in India (TITCO) and from 18,756 patients of the US National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), we derived models in one context and validated them in the other, assessing them for discrimination and calibration using systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Glasgow coma scale as candidate predictors.

RESULTS:Early mortality was 8\% in the TITCO and 1-2\% in the NTDB samples. Both models discriminated well, but the TITCO model overestimated the risk of mortality in NTDB patients, and the NTDB model underestimated the risk in TITCO patients.

CONCLUSION:Transferability was good in terms of discrimination but poor in terms of calibration. It was possible to improve this miscalibration by updating the models' intercept. This updating method could be used in samples with as few as 25 events.}},

title = {{EMS, Quality Improvement Programs}},
author = {Lincoln, Erin W and Jarvis, Jeffrey L},
abstract = {{Emergency Management Services (EMS) Quality Improvement is the intentional process of making something better in EMS. Quality Improvement (QI) focuses on making system-level changes in clinical processes. This differs from quality assurance, which is more consistent with protocol, process, or policy compliance. EMS QI programs work best in a just culture environment that implements change through a robust education program. Effective QI programs are transparent; both administration and clinical staff know the goals and methods of any improvement effort. Quality improvement programs often use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure ongoing clinical performance, identify areas for improvement, and assess the impact of process changes. EMS systems should build their KPIs on clinical evidence, a perceived system deficit, or an operational need. Quality improvement practices vary significantly among EMS agencies across the United States; however, a survey of EMS agencies nationwide in 2015 revealed that 71\% of agencies surveyed report having dedicated quality improvement personnel.[1] Examples of quality improvement projects include improving prehospital aspirin administration rates in patients with acute coronary syndromes, improving paramedic identification of STEMI, and decreasing peri-intubation hypoxia,[2] among others. Each of these projects began with identifying the need for improvement. They developed a plan that included a process change and a means for assessing the impact of that change.   Many EMS organizations elect to use the Institute of Healthcare Improvement Model of improvement: the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. Effective PDSA cycles should be organized with groups of people involved in all aspects of the process being improved. For example, a PDSA cycle looking to improve cardiac arrest survival should include field paramedics as well as staff from the medical director's office, administration, and logistics personnel.  Plan The purpose of the “plan step” is to clearly and concisely define the problem or need for improvement. It should include a definition of what improvement. This step should also brainstorm solutions, pick one solution to try, and generate a plan to test and implement the proposed solution. The committee should define the problem using as much objective data as possible. They should be clear about how they will measure both the extent of the problem and how they will determine if their change is an improvement. For example, if a system is attempting to improve aspirin administration rates, a successful change could be “aspirin administration, or the presence of an aspirin allergy is documented in 95\% of patient encounters with a chief complaint of chest pain.” The “plan” step also includes brainstorming as many ideas as possible  to answer the question “what intervention could lead to improvement?” The next part is the selection of a specific intervention, such as employee education, and a plan for reevaluation. The plan should answer several questions, including “What is the problem?" “What is the intervention?” “How will we measure the problem, the change, and the outcome?” and “How do we know a change is an improvement?” Do This is perhaps the least complex, but often the most difficult step to accomplish. Once a plan is made, the "Do" step is simply executing the plan. Pick a specific day in the immediate future to implement the plan. Instead of implementing the plan across the entire system all at once, first, perform a small trial of the change. This small step, known as a "test of change" allows the team to see if their change has the desired effect. Often, this small test identifies unexpected areas that should be addressed before wider implementation of the change. For example, if the change being tested is a checklist to improve intubation success, the checklist could be developed and trialed with one shift at a single ambulance station before deploying it for an entire system. Study The purpose of the “study” step is to determine if the plan that was designed and implemented caused a change that was an improvement. This determination should use the definition developed in the “plan” step. During this step, participants in the project should also look for any unintended outcomes. The team should discuss what aspects of the plan were functional and what parts of the plan didn’t work as intended. As with defining the problem, objective data is helpful in the “study” step. For the above intubation checklist example, this step could include evaluating success rates of intubations before and after the checklist, compliance with or use of the checklist. They should also get feedback on the checklist itself from the end-user. Other data, such as time on-scene, cardiac arrest rates, or other data that may be impacted by a change in intubation practices should be considered in this step as well. The most common tool for measuring the effects of these tests of change is the process control chart. These charts plot the proportion of cases that met the definition of success over time. They also include a marker demonstrating the point in time at which the change was implemented. Act The “Act” step is designed to take action on items found in the “study” step. Following the prior example, this might include improving an airway checklist based on the feedback provided by end users or providing additional training. Once the “Act” step is complete, the cycle begins again with planning: re-deploy an improved checklist, evaluate success rates, deploy the idea to an entire system, or receive additional feedback. This PDSA cycle is continued in an iterative process until the desired improvement is achieved. Key Components of QI ProgramNon-Punitive Culture A QI program must use a non-punitive approach.  A “Just Culture” strategy is a common example of this approach. Just culture is an organizational method that emphasizes accountability of both the individual and the organization in the prevention of errors and improvement.[3] Just culture also acknowledges that errors are often caused by a combination of factors, including system factors. It considers “near misses” to be as significant as actual errors.  A just culture approach encourages self-reporting of both near-misses and actual errors. It promotes accountability for one’s actions and education, an intolerance of ignorance, and a desire to improve the system for improved safety and outcomes constantly. Education Many quality improvement projects, especially clinical quality improvement projects, will require education of some form to propagate the information regarding the intervention. An individual or team with an educational focus is likely to be beneficial in achieving the desired improvement outcomes. Team-Based Approach A quality improvement project should involve representatives from any part of an organization that may be affected by the changes as a part or result of an improvement project. Additionally, involving individuals with many perspectives will increase the pool of unique ideas. The more ideas, the more likely the group is to find a successful change.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Rapid identification of COVID-19 cases, which is crucial to outbreak containment efforts, is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic symptoms and in settings with limited capacity for specialized nucleic acid-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
METHODS:This retrospective case-control study involves subjects (7 to 98 years) presenting at the designated national outbreak screening centre and tertiary care hospital in Singapore for SARS-CoV-2 testing from January 26 to February 16, 2020. COVID-19 status was confirmed by PCR testing of sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and exposure-risk variables ascertainable at presentation were analyzed to develop an algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19. Model development used Akaike's information criterion in a stepwise fashion to build logistic regression models, which were then translated into prediction scores. Performance was measured using receiver operating characteristics curves, adjusting for over-confidence using leave-out-one cross validation.

RESULTS:The study population included 788 subjects, of whom 54 (6.9\%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 734 (93.1\%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The median age was 34 years and 407 (51.7\%) were female. Using leave-out-one cross validation, all the models incorporating clinical tests (Models 1, 2 and 3) performed well with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.91, 0.88 and 0.88 respectively. In comparison, Model 4 had an AUC of 0.65.

CONCLUSIONS:Rapidly ascertainable clinical and laboratory data could identify individuals at high risk of COVID-19 and enable prioritization of PCR-testing and containment efforts. Basic laboratory test results were crucial to prediction models.}},

Although it is not the technique's aim, the measurement has to be considered an important component of Delphi analyses and data interpretation. During the past 60years, the Delphi multi-round survey procedure has been widely and successfully used to aggregate expert opinions on future developments and incidents. This paper is dedicated to how consensus (and dissent) has been measured since the technique's emergence in the 1960s and which criteria have been used. The review also includes a description of its relationship with the measurement of stability over Delphi rounds, although the major focus lies on the concept of consensus. In an extensive literature review, 15 types of measure were identified and classified for measuring consensus (and/or stability) in detail. The research reveals that there are obvious deficits in the practice and rigour of consensus measurement for Delphi research: mistakes in statistical tests or their premises have even been made. This article gives a broad understanding of the consensus concept, shows strengths and weaknesses as well as premises of different types of measure and concludes with lessons learned. Its major contribution is therefore on improving the future quality of consensus-oriented Delphi studies.}},

Economic evaluation is classified into three techniques such as cost minimization, cost effectiveness and cost benefit. It is impossible to compare cost-effectiveness ratios of alternative interventions when different units have been employed in their evaluation. In injury prevention, this becomes particularly limiting if one tries to compare the fatal and non-fatal injury prevention benefits of different interventions. An economic evaluation is only as good as the input values that one uses for the analysis. Fortunately, scientific progress in recent years has made it possible to apply economic evaluation techniques to a variety of injury control interventions.}},

Design: A purposively recruited Expert Advisory Panel of 12 end users used a modified Delphi technique to evaluate 53 tools and resources identified through a previously conducted systematic review. The panel comprised six practice managers and six general practitioners who had participated in the PC‐PIT pilot study in 2013–2014. Tools and resources were reviewed in three rounds using a standard pre‐tested assessment form. Recommendations, scores and reasons for recommending or rejecting each tool or resource were analysed to determine the final suite of tools and resources. The evaluation was conducted from November 2014 to August 2015. Results: Recommended tools and resources scored highly (mean score, 16/20) in Rounds 1 and 2 of review (n = 25). These tools and resources were perceived to be easily used, useful to the practice and supportive of the PC‐PIT. Rejected resources scored considerably lower (mean score, 5/20) and were noted to have limitations such as having no value to the practice and poor utility (n = 6). A final review (Round 3) of 28 resources resulted in a suite of 21 to support the elements of the PC‐PIT. Conclusions: This suite of tools and resources offers one approach to supporting the quality improvement initiatives currently in development in primary care reform.}},

abstract = {{A systematic analysis of trauma deaths is a step towards trauma quality improvement in Indian hospitals. This study estimates the magnitude of preventable trauma deaths in five Indian hospitals, and uses a peer-review process to identify opportunities for improvement (OFI) in trauma care delivery. All trauma deaths that occurred within 30\&nbsp;days of hospitalization in five urban university hospitals in India were retrospectively abstracted for demography, mechanism of injury, transfer status, injury description by clinical, investigation and operative findings. Using mixed methods, they were quantitatively stratified by the standardized Injury Severity Score (ISS) into mild (1–8), moderate (9–15), severe (16–25), profound (26–75) ISS categories, and by time to death within 24\&nbsp;h, 7, or 30\&nbsp;days. Using peer-review and Delphi methods, we defined optimal trauma care within the Indian context and evaluated each death for preventability, using the following categories: Preventable (P), Potentially preventable (PP), Non-preventable (NP) and Non-preventable but care could have been improved (NPI). During the 18\&nbsp;month study period, there were 11,671 trauma admissions and 2523 deaths within 30\&nbsp;days (21.6\%). The overall proportion of preventable deaths was 58\%, among 2057 eligible deaths. In patients with a mild ISS score, 71\% of deaths were preventable. In the moderate category, 56\% were preventable, and 60\% in the severe group and 44\% in the profound group were preventable. Traumatic brain injury and burns accounted for the majority of non-preventable deaths. The important areas for improvement in the preventable deaths subset, inadequacies in airway management (14.3\%) and resuscitation with hemorrhage control (16.3\%). System-related issues included lack of protocols, lack of adherence to protocols, pre-hospital delays and delays in imaging. Fifty-eight percent of all trauma deaths were classified as preventable. Two-thirds of the deaths with injury severity scores of less than 16 were preventable. This large subgroup of Indian urban trauma patients could possibly be saved by urgent attention and corrective action. Low-cost interventions such as airway management, fluid resuscitation, hemorrhage control and surgical decision-making protocols, were identified as OFI. Establishment of clinical protocols and timely processes of trauma care delivery are the next steps towards improving care.}},

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:Clinical prediction models estimate the risk of having or developing a particular outcome or disease. Researchers often develop a new model when a previously developed model is validated and the performance is poor. However, the model can be adjusted (updated) using the new data. The updated model is then based on both the development and validation data. We show how a simple updating method may suffice to update a clinical prediction model.
METHODS:A prediction model that preoperatively predicts the risk of severe postoperative pain was developed with multivariable logistic regression from the data of 1944 surgical patients in the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We studied the predictive performance of the model in 1,035 new patients, scheduled for surgery at a later time in the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. We assessed the calibration (agreement between predicted risks and the observed frequencies of an outcome) and discrimination (ability of the model to distinguish between patients with and without postoperative pain). When the incidence of the outcome is different, all predicted risks may be systematically over- or underestimated. Hence, the intercept of the model can be adjusted (updating).

RESULTS:The predicted risks were systematically higher than the observed frequencies, corresponding to a difference in the incidence of postoperative pain between the development (62\%) and validation set (36\%). The updated model resulted in better calibration.

DISCUSSION:When a clinical prediction model in new patients does not show adequate performance, an alternative to developing a new model is to update the prediction model with new data. The updated model will be based on more patient data, and may yield better risk estimates.}},

journal = {Lancet (London, England)},
doi = {10.1016/s0140-6736(18)32203-7},
abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017.
METHODS:The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries-Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised.

FINDINGS:At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73·4\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 72·5-74·1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18·6\% (17·9-19·6), and injuries 8·0\% (7·7-8·2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22·7\% (21·5-23·9), representing an additional 7·61 million (7·20-8·01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7·9\% (7·0-8·8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22·2\% (20·0-24·0) and the death rate by 31·8\% (30·1-33·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2·3\% (0·5-4·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13·7\% (12·2-15·1) to 57·9 deaths (55·9-59·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000-289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000-363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118·0\% (88·8-148·6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36·4\% (32·2-40·6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33·6\% (31·2-36·1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990-neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases-were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases.

INTERPRETATION:Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Extensive literature documents personal distress among physicians and a decrease in their satisfaction with the practice of medicine over recent years. We hypothesized that physicians who spent more of their time in the aspect of work that they found most meaningful would have a lower risk of burnout.
METHODS:Faculty physicians in the Department of Internal Medicine at a large academic medical center were surveyed in the fall of 2007. The survey evaluated demographic variables, work characteristics, and career satisfaction. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Additional questions evaluated which professional activity (eg, research, education, patient care, or administration) was most personally meaningful and the percentage of effort that was devoted to each activity.

RESULTS:Of 556 physicians sampled, 465 (84\%) returned surveys. A majority (68\%) reported that patient care was the aspect of work that they found most meaningful, with smaller percentages reporting research (19\%), education (9\%), or administration (3\%) as being most meaningful. Overall, 34\% of faculty members met the criteria for burnout. The amount of time spent working on the most meaningful activity was strongly related to the risk of burnout. Those spending less than 20\% of their time (approximately 1 d/wk) on the activity that is most meaningful to them had higher rates of burnout (53.8\% vs 29.9\%; P<.001). Time spent on the most meaningful activity was the largest predictor of burnout on multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 2.75; P = .001).

CONCLUSIONS:The extent to which faculty physicians are able to focus on the aspect of work that is most meaningful to them has a strong inverse relationship to their risk of burnout. Efforts to optimize career fit may promote physician satisfaction and help to reduce attrition among academic faculty physicians.}},

The objective of this study was to estimate teh proportion of preventable trauma deaths and the factors contributing to poor outcome using peer review in a tertiary care hospital in a developing country.
METHODS:All trauma deaths during a 2-year period (1 January 1998 to 30 December 1998) were identified and registered in a computerized trauma registry, and the probability of survival was calculated for all patients. Summary data, including registry information and details of prehospital, emergency room, and definitive care, were provided to all members of the peer review committee 1 week before the committee meeting. The committee then reviewed all cases and classified each death as preventable, potentially preventable, or non-preventable.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:A total fo 279 patients were registered in the trauma registry during the study period, including 18 trauma deaths. Peer review judged that six were preventable, seven were potentially preventable, and four were non-preventable. One patient was excluded because the record was not available for review. The proportion of preventable and potentially preventable deaths was significantly higher in our study than from developed countries. Of the multiple contributing factors identified, the most important were inadequate prehospital transfer, limited hospital resources, and an absence of integrated and organized trauma care. This study summarizes the challenges faced in trauma care in a developing country.}},

RESULTS:Emergency physicians in the U.S. emergency departments and sometimes other settings provide urgent and emergency care to patients of all ages, including definitive diagnosis of emergent conditions, prolonged stabilization of patients when necessary, airway management, and life-saving procedures using rapid sequence intubation and sedation. They use a multitude of diagnostic technologies including laboratory studies, bedside ultrasound and other sophisticated radiology, such as CT scan, and MRI.

PATIENTS:We studied data from 210,942 patients admitted to 35 trauma centers in Pennsylvania between 2000 and 2009.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Regression analyses were performed to examine the association between ACSCOT quality indicators and in-hospital mortality and death or major complications.

RESULTS:Seven of the ACSCOT quality indicators were associated with either increased (1) in-hospital mortality or (2) death or major complications. No head computed tomography scan in patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 13 was associated with a 4-fold increase in mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.39; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.18-6.07) and a nearly 3-fold increased risk of death or major complications (AOR, 2.76; 95\% CI 2.05-3.72). Gunshot wounds to the abdomen managed nonoperatively were associated with a nearly 5-fold increase in mortality (AOR, 4.80; 95\% CI, 2.95-7.81). Femoral fractures treated with nonfixation were also strongly associated with mortality (AOR, 4.08; 95\% CI, 2.50-6.66) and death or major complications (AOR, 2.54; 95\% CI, 1.96-3.31).

CONCLUSION:Several current ACSCOT quality indicators have a strong association with clinical outcomes. These findings should be interpreted with caution because some measures may lack face validity for identifying poor-quality care in complex patients with multiple injuries.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:Consultant based delivery of emergency service is perceived to add value. This study aims to demonstrate the impact of such a service model based on consultant working in a UK emergency department.
METHODS:This retrospective study was based on the emergency department of a district general hospital. Activity data was analysed for 2009. Workload and admission rates were compared between consultants, middle grade doctors and senior house officers (SHOs). Admission rates were compared against two similar departments. Data from night shifts allowed consultant activity to be contrasted with middle grades and SHOs. Time spent in the department, admission rates, patients who left without treatment, discharged outright and clinic returns were used for comparison.

RESULTS:Consultants often saw more patients than SHOs or middle grade doctors. This was on top of their traditional duties of senior opinion. On comparison of activity at night shifts, they admitted fewer (25.2\% vs 30.3\%, p=0.026), had fewer leaving without treatment (1.6\% vs 5.1\%, p<0.001), discharged more outright (59.8\% vs 47.5\%, p<0.001), referred fewer to clinic (5.7\% vs 6.6\%, p=0.49) and had a faster turnaround time (p<0.001: Priority 2, 3 and 4) for every triage category. Some of the comparisons were clinically but not statistically significant.

CONCLUSION:A consultant based service delivery offers many advantages. These cannot be matched by either junior or middle grades. This would be in addition to the consultants' supervisory role. Consultant expansion is urgently required to achieve this sustainably. A further study evaluating the cost benefits of this service model is now underway.}},

However, equivalent, context-appropriate audit filters for use in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) district-level hospitals have not been well established. We aimed to develop context-appropriate trauma care audit filters for district-level hospitals in Ghana, was well as other LMICs more broadly.MethodsConsensus on trauma care audit filters was built between twenty panellists using a Delphi technique with four anonymous, iterative surveys designed to elicit: (i) trauma care processes to be measured; (ii) important features of audit filters for the district-level hospital setting; and (iii) potentially useful filters. Filters were ranked on a scale from 0 to 10 (10 being very useful). Consensus was measured with average percent majority opinion (APMO) cut-off rate. Target consensus was defined a priori as: a median rank of ≥9 for each filter and an APMO cut-off rate of ≥0.8.ResultsPanellists agreed on trauma care processes to target (e.g. triage, phases of trauma assessment, early referral if needed) and specific features of filters for district-level hospital use (e.g. simplicity, unassuming of resource capacity). APMO cut-off rate increased successively: Round 1 – 0.58; Round 2 – 0.66; Round 3 – 0.76; and Round 4 – 0.82. After Round 4, target consensus on 22 trauma care and referral-specific filters was reached. Example filters include: triage – vital signs are recorded within 15min of arrival (must include breathing assessment, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation if available); circulation – a large bore IV was placed within 15min of patient arrival; referral – if referral is activated, the referring clinician and receiving facility communicate by phone or radio prior to transfer.ConclusionThis study proposes trauma care audit filters appropriate for LMIC district-level hospitals. Given the successes of similar filters in HICs and obstetric care filters in LMICs, the collection and reporting of prospective trauma care audit filters may be an important step towards improving care for the injured at district-level hospitals in LMICs.}},

OBJECTIVES:To compare the effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on 30-day in-hospital mortality among critically ill adults with sepsis.

METHODS:Secondary analysis of patients from the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) admitted to the medical intensive care unit with an ICD-10-CM code for sepsis, using multivariable regression to control for potential confounders.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:Of 15,802 patients enrolled in SMART, 1,641 patients were admitted to the medical intensive care unit with a diagnosis of sepsis. A total of 217 patients (26.3\%) in the balanced crystalloids group experienced 30-day in-hospital morality, compared with 255 patients (31.2\%) in the saline group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95\% confidence interval, 0.59 - 0.93; P = 0.01). Patients in the balanced group experienced a lower incidence of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (35.4\% vs 40.1\%; aOR 0.78; 95\% CI 0.63 - 0.97) and a greater number of vasopressor-free days (20 ± 12 vs 19 ± 13; aOR 1.25; 95\% CI 1.02 - 1.54) and renal replacement therapy-free days (20 ± 12 vs 19 ± 13; aOR 1.35 [1.08 - 1.69]), compared to the saline group.

CONCLUSIONS:Among patients with sepsis in a large randomized trial, use of balanced crystalloids was associated with a lower 30-day in-hospital mortality compared to use of saline. Clinical trial registration available at www.clinicaltrials.gov, ID: NCT02444988.}},

In summarizing the evidence and recommendations regarding trauma care, this review identifies essential research and development goals to address the burden of injury in India.
METHODS:A review of the literature was conducted between August 2014 and September 2014. The literature was sorted into 3 categories: prehospital care, hospital clinical care, and hospital administrative care. The characteristics of trauma care were explored using the Essential Trauma Care Project of the World Health Organization.

RESULTS:A total of 38 studies were included. Prehospital care lacked care provided at the scene of the injury, timely transport to a hospital, and transport via ambulance. With regard to hospital care, we found a lack of capabilities of basic clinical care, such as airway management, insertion of chest tubes, and efforts at resuscitation. There was a lack of administrative capabilities, including trauma data systems, trauma-specific training, quality improvement, and development of designated trauma teams.

CONCLUSION:The high rate of injury-related deaths and disabilities in India could be in part due to the absence of integrated and organized systems of trauma care. In the prehospital setting, a multisector approach must be implemented to address the training of emergency medical service providers and community members. Prehospital transport time can be decreased through improved communication and transport modalities. The Indian trauma care system could also be strengthened through hospital-based training programs and trauma response teams.}},

abstract = {{<h3>When Less Is More</h3> <p>Clinical models play an important role in guiding patient care at the bedside, improving our understanding of diseases, and performing objective assessments of healthcare quality. The typical approach to developing these models places great importance on fitting historical patient outcomes in derivation data sets (such as those obtained from clinical studies or patient registries). However, for a fairly broad range of medical applications, these derivation data sets may be small after accounting for inclusionary and exclusionary criteria, and additionally may be imperfectly characterized due to noise and variations in the rates of patient outcomes. Collecting more data offers one approach to address this issue, but is challenging due to the costs and complexity of increasing the size of clinical cohorts. In the setting of small and imperfectly characterized data sets, approaches to developing clinical models that rely exclusively on fitting historical patient outcomes suffer from the implicit assumption that the derivation data sets are representative. Instead, as the new study by Chia <i>et al.</i> explores, the process of developing clinical models can be improved by decreasing the importance placed on fitting historical patient outcomes, and by supplementing these models with information about the extent to which patients differ from the statistical distribution of clinical characteristics within the derivation data set. When evaluated using data from three different clinical applications [patients with acute coronary syndrome enrolled in the DISPERSE2-TIMI33 and MERLIN-TIMI36 trials, patients undergoing inpatient surgery in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) registry, and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2) registry], this approach of treating derivation data for clinical models as simultaneously labeled and unlabeled consistently improved discrimination between high- and low-risk patients according to different statistical metrics. The idea of decreasing the importance assigned to fitting historical outcomes allows for better clinical models, and ultimately for improvements in the use of these models to study diseases, choose therapies, or evaluate healthcare providers.</p>}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:To predict hospital admission at the time of ED triage using patient history in addition to information collected at triage.
METHODS:This retrospective study included all adult ED visits between March 2014 and July 2017 from one academic and two community emergency rooms that resulted in either admission or discharge. A total of 972 variables were extracted per patient visit. Samples were randomly partitioned into training (80\%), validation (10\%), and test (10\%) sets. We trained a series of nine binary classifiers using logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep neural networks (DNN) on three dataset types: one using only triage information, one using only patient history, and one using the full set of variables. Next, we tested the potential benefit of additional training samples by training models on increasing fractions of our data. Lastly, variables of importance were identified using information gain as a metric to create a low-dimensional model.

RESULTS:A total of 560,486 patient visits were included in the study, with an overall admission risk of 29.7\%. Models trained on triage information yielded a test AUC of 0.87 for LR (95\% CI 0.86-0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95\% CI 0.87-0.88) and 0.87 for DNN (95\% CI 0.87-0.88). Models trained on patient history yielded an AUC of 0.86 for LR (95\% CI 0.86-0.87), 0.87 for XGBoost (95\% CI 0.87-0.87) and 0.87 for DNN (95\% CI 0.87-0.88). Models trained on the full set of variables yielded an AUC of 0.91 for LR (95\% CI 0.91-0.91), 0.92 for XGBoost (95\% CI 0.92-0.93) and 0.92 for DNN (95\% CI 0.92-0.92). All algorithms reached maximum performance at 50\% of the training set or less. A low-dimensional XGBoost model built on ESI level, outpatient medication counts, demographics, and hospital usage statistics yielded an AUC of 0.91 (95\% CI 0.91-0.91).

CONCLUSION:Machine learning can robustly predict hospital admission using triage information and patient history. The addition of historical information improves predictive performance significantly compared to using triage information alone, highlighting the need to incorporate these variables into prediction models.}},

As an example, we analysed 30-day mortality after acute myocardial infarction in a large data set (GUSTO-I, n = 40 830). We validated and updated a previously published model from another study (TIMI-II, n = 3339) in validation samples ranging from small (200 patients, 14 deaths) to large (10,000 patients, 700 deaths). Updated models were tested on independent patients. Updating methods included re-calibration (re-estimation of the intercept or slope of the linear predictor) and more structural model revisions (re-estimation of some or all regression coefficients, model extension with more predictors). We applied heuristic shrinkage approaches in the model revision methods, such that regression coefficients were shrunken towards their re-calibrated values. Parsimonious updating methods were found preferable to more extensive model revisions, which should only be attempted with relatively large validation samples in combination with shrinkage.}},

In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.}},

abstract = {{Background: Injuries remain an important public health concern, resulting in considerable annual morbidity and mortality. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the lack of appropriate infrastructure, equipment and skilled personnel compound the burden of injury, leading to higher mortality rates. As Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) courses remain uneconomical and inappropriate in LMICs, the Primary Trauma Care (PTC) course was introduced to provide an alternative that is both sustainable and appropriate to local resources. Methods: A systematic review was performed in May 2019, utilising MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. All studies reporting patient related outcomes (mortality and morbidity rates) and course participant related outcomes (knowledge, confidence and skills) in LMICs were included. PRISMA guidelines were adhered to throughout. Results: Nine observational studies were identified (Level 3 evidence). Six studies reported improved knowledge in injury management post-PTC course (p < 0.05). Two studies reported improvements in confidence (p < 0.05) and one on skill attainment (p < 0.0001). One study reported a reduction in mortality rates post-PTC course (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Departmental, institutional and personal improvements may occur in clinical practice as a result of formal PTC training of trauma team members in LMICs. Further high-quality research is needed to evaluate this course's effects on observed change in clinical practice and patient outcomes. This may require long-term observational and epidemiological studies to assess improvements in morbidity and mortality. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42019133986}},

In 2010, London implemented an inclusive trauma system. This represented an opportunity to evaluate the impact of a pan-regional trauma system on quality of care.

The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction.

abstract = {{Quality assurance/quality improvement (QA-QI) is a priority for maintaining the highest standards of care in trauma systems. To be an effective tool for system review, the QA-QI indicators should identify patients with higher rates of morbidity and mortality from injury. While the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Operations have identified certain audit filters within the trauma system, there are few data to substantiate the value of these audit filters for trauma care. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of the ACS trauma indicators to predict adverse patient outcome following injury requiring review. The study population consisted of 44,019 patients from the North Carolina State Trauma Registry from 1987 to 1992. Of the 22 audit filters nine were available for analysis. Mortality rate, length of stay, and total charges were used as measures of outcome. The hypotheses tested were that patients who met the indicator criteria would have higher mortality rates and worse outcomes than the non-indicator group. Student's t test and Chi-square analysis were used to test the differences between the group which met the criteria for the indicator and those without. Of the nine audit filters tested, only three were found to have significantly worse outcomes than their non-indicator comparison group: gunshot wound to the abdomen with non-surgical management, femur fracture without fixation, and complications from pulmonary embolism-deep vein thrombosis-decubitus ulcer (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, four of the audit filters, coma without intubation, laparotomy > 2 hours, transfer > 6 hours, and admission to non-surgical service, actually had significantly better outcomes than their non-indicator counterpart. Scene time > 20 minutes, laparotomy > 2 hours after arrival, and craniotomy > 4 hours after arrival may be indicators of patients at risk for morbidity. This study demonstrates that several ACS clinical indicators, as currently written, are not useful in identifying patients at higher risk for poor outcome. The indicators need further definition to be of value in the quality review process. Specifically, the study suggests that audit filters should be data driven and based upon analyses of large populations of injured patients and their outcomes to be valid QA-QI tools.}},

abstract = {{Tension pneumothorax is variously defined but is generally thought of as a pneumothorax in which the pressure of intrapleural gas exceeds atmospheric pressure, producing adverse effects, including mediastinal shift associated with cardiovascular collapse, often attributed to reduced venous return and kinking of the great vessels. The mechanism of tension pneumothorax is said to be a valvular defect in the visceral pleura such that air enters the pleural space in inspiration but cannot exit in expiration, leading to a progressive increase in pressure. However, as the driving pressure forcing air into the pleura in inspiration is atmospheric pressure, the pleural pressure can never exceed 1 atm during inspiration in a spontaneously breathing subject. Furthermore, all pneumothoraces must have pressures greater than atmospheric during expiration, or conventional treatment with intercostal tube drainage would not work. Pilot experiments have failed to show any re-entry of pleural gas into the lung in patients with persistent air leaks but no evidence of tension, suggesting these behave as valvular pneumothoraces. Case reports of tension pneumothorax in spontaneously breathing patients are rare, and most patients have other explanations for clinical deterioration. Although a large and rapidly expanding pneumothorax may require urgent intervention, it is unlikely that the effects are mediated by high intrapleural pressures. The term tension pneumothorax in spontaneously breathing patients should be reconsidered.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Each year approximately five million people die from injuries. In countries where systems of trauma care have been introduced, death and disability have decreased. A major component of developed trauma systems is a trauma quality improvement (TQI) program and trauma quality improvement meeting (TQIM). Effective TQIMs improve trauma care by identifying and fixing problems. But globally, TQIMs are absent or unstructured in most hospitals providing trauma care. The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate a checklist for a structured TQIM.
METHODS:This project was conducted as a prospective before-and-after study in four major trauma centres in India. The intervention was the introduction of a structured TQIM using a checklist, introduced with a workshop. This workshop was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) TQI Programs short course and resources, plus the developed TQIM checklist. Pre- and post-intervention data collection occurred at all meetings in which cases of trauma death were discussed. The primary outcome was TQIM Checklist compliance, defined by the discussion of, and agreement upon each of the following: preventability of death, identification of opportunities to improve care and corrective actions and a plan for closing the loop.

RESULTS:There were 34 meetings in each phase, with 99 cases brought to the pre-intervention phase and 125 cases brought to the post-intervention phase. There was an increase in the proportion of cases brought to the meeting for which preventability of death was discussed (from 94\% to 100\%, p = 0.007) and agreed (from 7 to 19\%, OR 3.7; 95\% CI:1.4-9.4, p = 0.004) and for which a plan for closing the loop was discussed (from 2\% to 18\%, OR 10.9; 95\% CI:2.5-47.6, p < 0.001) and agreed (from 2\% to 18\%, OR 10.9; 95\% CI:2.5-47.6, p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION:This study developed, implemented and evaluated a TQIM Checklist for improving TQIM processes. The introduction of a TQIM Checklist, with training, into four Indian trauma centres, led to more structured TQIMs, including increased discussion and agreement on preventability of death and plans for loop closure. A TQIM Checklist should be considered for all centres managing trauma patients.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The Trauma Quality Improvement Program was designed by the American College of Surgeons to measure quality benchmarks across American College of Surgeons-certified trauma centers. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey was developed to report patient satisfaction with inpatient care and has been used as a surrogate for quality of care by the Affordable Care Act. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation of hospitals' Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems data to the Trauma Quality Improvement Program quality analysis.
METHODS:A retrospective review of available Trauma Quality Improvement Program and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems results from an American College of Surgeons level 1 trauma center 2016-2017 was performed. Trauma Quality Improvement Program and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems data were represented as either above, at, or below the mean of national data and were analyzed using the Fisher exact test.

RESULTS:Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores from wards participating in care of trauma patients were summarized by perceived level of quality. Trauma Quality Improvement Program data for risk-adjusted mortality were included in analysis for all trauma admissions. The Fisher exact test was used to analyze contingency tables of data and was found to support the null hypothesis (P = .1109).

CONCLUSION:Overall Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems rating is most significant for hospitals because it is a global view of patient satisfaction and is used to determine a portion of hospital reimbursement. It is believed that higher patient satisfaction is correlated with lower readmission rates and improved outcomes, thus resulting in cost savings for hospitals. However, it appears that overall Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems rating does not correlate with measured outcomes in terms of risk-adjusted mortality for trauma admissions. It is suggested from these data that trauma patients be considered independently from other hospitalizations and that Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems may not be an appropriate tool to determine reimbursement for trauma admission.}},

abstract = {{A clinical prediction model is a tool for predicting healthcare outcomes, usually within a specific population and context. A common approach is to develop a new clinical prediction model for each population and context; however, this wastes potentially useful historical information. A better approach is to update or incorporate the existing clinical prediction models already developed for use in similar contexts or populations. In addition, clinical prediction models commonly become miscalibrated over time, and need replacing or updating. In this article, we review a range of approaches for re-using and updating clinical prediction models; these fall in into three main categories: simple coefficient updating, combining multiple previous clinical prediction models in a meta-model and dynamic updating of models. We evaluated the performance (discrimination and calibration) of the different strategies using data on mortality following cardiac surgery in the United Kingdom: We found that no single strategy performed sufficiently well to be used to the exclusion of the others. In conclusion, useful tools exist for updating existing clinical prediction models to a new population or context, and these should be implemented rather than developing a new clinical prediction model from scratch, using a breadth of complementary statistical methods.}},

DESIGN:Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Total patient population at risk and audit filter fallouts were evaluated for the following audit filters: patients with (1) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 14 who did not receive a CT scan within 2 hours of admission; (2) subdural/ epidural hematomas who did not undergo craniotomy within 4 hours; (3) open tibial fractures who did not undergo debridement within 8 hours; (4) abdominal gunshot wounds who did not undergo laparotomy within 4 hours; and (5) all deaths where a quality assurance action was taken. The filters were used for 1 year. Mortality was compared between fallouts and nonfallouts in each category and the frequency of corrective actions for each category were determined.

RESULTS:Corrective actions were taken in 97 of the 418 fallouts from 3,787 patients at risk. The majority (77\%) of these actions were for patients in the death audit filter group. There were 343 nondeath fallouts, representing 13\% of the 2,719 nondeath patients at risk. Of these, 22 corrective actions were taken, representing 6.4\% of the fallouts and less than 1\% of the patients at risk.

CONCLUSION:The non-death process based audit filters that we evaluated in our trauma system documented adherence to care process standards but found few opportunities for quality improvement, suggesting that audit filters should be periodically evaluated and changed when their goals have been accomplished.}},

Dealing with a spinal anaesthetic which is in some way inadequate can be very difficult; so, the technique must be performed in a way which minimizes the risk of regional block. Thus, practitioners must be aware of all the possible mechanisms of failure so that, where possible, these mechanisms can be avoided. This review has considered the mechanisms in a sequential way: problems with lumbar puncture; errors in the preparation and injection of solutions; inadequate spreading of drugs through cerebrospinal fluid; failure of drug action on nervous tissue; and difficulties more related to patient management than the actual block. Techniques for minimizing the possibility of failure are discussed, all of them requiring, in essence, close attention to detail. Options for managing an inadequate block include repeating the injection, manipulation of the patient's posture to encourage wider spread of the injected solution, supplementation with local anaesthetic infiltration by the surgeon, use of systemic sedation or analgesic drugs, and recourse to general anaesthesia. Follow-up procedures must include full documentation of what happened, the provision of an explanation to the patient and, if indicated by events, detailed investigation.}},

We use “medical care” rather than “health care” to refer to clinical services, to avoid potential confusion between “health” and “health care.” The World Health Organization's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health has defined SDH as “the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age” and “the fundamental drivers of these conditions.” The term “social determinants” often evokes factors such as health-related features of neighborhoods (e g., walkability, recreational areas, and accessibility of healthful foods), which can influence health-related behaviors. Evidence has accumulated, however, pointing to socioeconomic factors such as income, wealth, and education as the fundamental causes of a wide range of health outcomes This article broadly reviews some of the knowledge accumulated to date that highlights the importance of social—and particularly socioeconomic—factors in shaping health, and plausible pathways and biological mechanisms that may explain their effects.

Little is known about the comparative effectiveness in reducing mortality of trauma care systems at different stages of development. The objective of this study was to review the literature and examine differences in mortality associated with different stages of trauma system development. A systematic review of peer-reviewed population-based studies retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Additional studies were identified from references of articles, through database searching, and author lists. Articles written in English and published between 2000 and 2020 were included. Selection of studies, data extraction, and quality assessment of the included studies were performed by two independent reviewers. The results were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95 \% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 52 studies with a combined 1,106,431 traumatic injury patients were included for quantitative analysis. The overall mortality rate was 6.77\% (n = 74,930). When patients were treated in a non-trauma centre compared to a trauma centre, the pooled statistical odds of mortality were reduced (OR 0.74 [95\% CI 0.69–0.79]; p < 0.001). When patients were treated in a non-trauma system compared to a trauma system the odds of mortality rates increased (OR 1.17 [95\% CI 1.10–1.24]; p < 0.001). When patients were treated in a post-implementation/initial system compared to a mature system, odds of mortality were significantly higher (OR 1.46 [95\% CI 1.37–1.55]; p < 0.001). The present study highlights that the survival of traumatic injured patients varies according to the stage of trauma system development in which the patient was treated. The analysis indicates a significant reduction in mortality following the introduction of the trauma system which is further enhanced as the system matures. These results provide evidence to support efforts to, firstly, implement trauma systems in countries currently without and, secondly, to enhance existing systems by investing in system development.

abstract = {{Background The global agenda does not address a significant amount of preventable death in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While illnesses requiring acute care are increasing at an alarming rate in these countries, there are inadequate numbers of physicians or nurses to deal with the growing burden. Many people feel that emergency systems are too expensive and restricted in scope to have public health implications in resource-limited areas. Little empirical data exists to suggest otherwise. The goal of this study was to delineate the type and frequency of emergency conditions and define a novel method to estimate the burden of emergency diseases in Fort Liberte, Haiti. Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional medical record review was performed on all emergency room visits to Fort Liberte Hospital in 2009 and 2010. The type, frequency, and annual incidence of emergency conditions were identified and used to determine the burden of emergency disease. A disability-adjusted life year (DALY) calculation was estimated using a variation on a model of indirect national data extrapolation to cities. Results Nineteen months of data available yielded 2000 charts with 2284 diagnoses in total. Trauma was the most common illness at 13\% of all charts, followed by abdominal pain at 11\%, gastroenteritis at 8\%, skin and soft tissue infections at 7\%, and hypertension at 6\%. The DALY calculation showed disability from emergency conditions to be five times that of HIV, malaria, and TB combined. Conclusions Sufficient emergency burden of disease affects population health in Fort Liberte, Haiti to warrant addressing it as a public health concern. The kinds of conditions described in this review may be amenable to task shifting as a feasible, sustainable, and scalable way to address the burden in a cost-effective manner.}},

Previous research has shown that when severely injured patients are managed in an organized system of care that includes treatment by paramedics, transportation to a hospital that has specialist doctors available to treat their injuries, and additional health personnel to help them to rehabilitate, patients are more likely to survive and suffer fewer disabilities. There are a number of ways that the quality of care provided to injured patients in a trauma system can be determined and improved. Trauma audit filters are descriptions of specific actions that should be taken, timeframes in which tests or treatments should be provided, or outcomes that are expected to occur in injured patients. Reviewing the charts of patients whose care deviates from that described by an audit filter and providing feedback to the clinicians involved in that patient's care is expected to provide a means of correcting errors and improving future performance. Our study tried to determine how effective audit filters are at improving trauma care. We were unable to find any studies to include in the review. More studies are needed to determine if audit filters are effective in improving care and, if they are, how effective they are in comparison to other quality improvement strategies.}},

abstract = {{STUDY OBJECTIVES:The goal of this study was to identify publications in the medical literature that support the efficacy or value of Emergency Medicine (EM) as a medical specialty and of clinical care delivered by trained emergency physicians. In this study we use the term "value" to refer both to the "efficacy of clinical care" in terms of achieving desired patient outcomes, as well as "efficiency" in terms of effective and/or cost-effective utilization of healthcare resources in delivering emergency care. A comprehensive listing of publications describing the efficacy or value of EM has not been previously published. It is anticipated that the accumulated reference list generated by this study will serve to help promote awareness of the value of EM as a medical specialty, and acceptance and development of the specialty of EM in countries where EM is new or not yet fully established.
METHODS:The January 1995 to October 2010 issues of selected journals, including the EM journals with the highest article impact factors, were reviewed to identify articles of studies or commentaries that evaluated efficacy, effectiveness, and/or value related to EM as a specialty or to clinical care delivered by EM practitioners. Articles were included if they found a positive or beneficial effect of EM or of EM physician-provided medical care. Additional articles that had been published prior to 1995 or in other non-EM journals already known to the authors were also included.

RESULTS:A total of 282 articles were identified, and each was categorized into one of the following topics: efficacy of EM for critical care and procedures (31 articles), efficacy of EM for efficiency or cost of care (30 articles), efficacy of EM for public health or preventive medicine (34 articles), efficacy of EM for radiology (11 articles), efficacy of EM for trauma or airway management (27 articles), efficacy of EM for using ultrasound (56 articles), efficacy of EM faculty (34 articles), efficacy of EM residencies (24 articles), and overviews and editorials of EM efficacy and value (35 articles).

CONCLUSION:There is extensive medical literature that supports the efficacy and value for both EM as a medical specialty and for emergency patient care delivered by trained EM physicians.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:We aimed to build a model using machine learning for the prediction of survival in trauma patients and compared these model predictions to those predicted by the most commonly used algorithm, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS).
METHODS:Enrolled hospitalized trauma patients from 2009 to 2016 were divided into a training dataset (70\% of the original data set) for generation of a plausible model under supervised classification, and a test dataset (30\% of the original data set) to test the performance of the model. The training and test datasets comprised 13,208 (12,871 survival and 337 mortality) and 5603 (5473 survival and 130 mortality) patients, respectively. With the provision of additional information such as pre-existing comorbidity status or laboratory data, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) (with the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (RSNNS)) were used to build models of survival prediction and compared to the predictive performance of TRISS. Predictive performance was evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as by area under the curve (AUC) measures of receiver operating characteristic curves.

RESULTS:In the validation dataset, NN and the TRISS presented the highest score (82.0\%) for balanced accuracy, followed by SVM (75.2\%) and LR (71.8\%) models. In the test dataset, NN had the highest balanced accuracy (75.1\%), followed by the TRISS (70.2\%), SVM (70.6\%), and LR (68.9\%) models. All four models (LR, SVM, NN, and TRISS) exhibited a high accuracy of more than 97.5\% and a sensitivity of more than 98.6\%. However, NN exhibited the highest specificity (51.5\%), followed by the TRISS (41.5\%), SVM (40.8\%), and LR (38.5\%) models.

CONCLUSIONS:These four models (LR, SVM, NN, and TRISS) exhibited a similar high accuracy and sensitivity in predicting the survival of the trauma patients. In the test dataset, the NN model had the highest balanced accuracy and predictive specificity.}},

abstract = {{Objectives To systematically review the literature on quality indicators (QIs) for evaluating trauma care, identify QIs, map their definitions, and examine the evidence base in support of the QIs.Data Sources We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through January 14, 2009. To increase the sensitivity of the search, we also searched the grey literature and select journals by hand, reviewed reference lists to identify additional studies, and contacted experts in the field.Study Selection and Data Extraction We selected all articles that identified or proposed 1 or more QIs to evaluate the quality of care delivered to patients with major traumatic injuries. Minimum inclusion criteria were a description of 1 or more QIs designed to evaluate patients with major traumatic injuries (defined as multisystem injuries resulting in hospitalization or death) and focused on prehospital care, hospital care, posthospital care, or secondary injury prevention.Data Synthesis The literature search identified 6869 citations. Review of abstracts led to the retrieval of 538 full-text articles for assessment, of which 192 articles were selected for review. Of these, 128 (66.7\%) articles were original research, predominantly trauma database case series (57 [29.7\%]) and cohort studies (55 [28.6\%]), whereas 37 (19.3\%) were narrative reviews and 8 (4.2\%) were guidelines. A total of 1572 QIs in trauma care were identified and classified into 8 categories: non-American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT) audit filters (42.0\%), ACS-COT audit filters (19.1\%), patient safety indicators (13.2\%), trauma center/system criteria (10.2\%), indicators measuring or benchmarking outcomes of care (7.4\%), peer review (5.5\%), general audit measures (1.8\%), and guideline availability or adherence (0.8\%). Measures of prehospital and hospital processes (60.4\%) and outcomes (22.8\%) were the most common QIs identified. Posthospital and secondary injury prevention QIs accounted for less than 5\% of QIs.Conclusions Many QIs for evaluating the quality of trauma care have been proposed, but the evidence to support these indicators is not strong. Practical recommendations to select QIs to measure the quality of trauma care will require systematic reviews of identified candidate indicators and empirical studies to fill the knowledge gaps for postacute QIs.}},

The Ottawa Statement on the Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomised Trials is the first international ethical guidance document specific to cluster trials, but it is unknown if it adequately addresses issues in low-resource settings. In this paper, we seek to identify any gaps in the Ottawa Statement relevant to cluster trials conducted in low-resource settings. Our method is (1) to analyse a prototypical cluster trial conducted in a low-resource setting ( PURE Malawi trial ) with the Ottawa Statement ; (2) to identify ethical issues in the design or conduct of the trial not captured adequately and (3) to make recommendations for issues needing attention in forthcoming revisions to the Ottawa Statement . Our analysis identified six ethical aspects of cluster randomised trials in low-resource settings that require further guidance. The forthcoming revision of the Ottawa Statement should provide additional guidance on these issues: (1) streamlining research ethics committee review for collaborating investigators who are affiliated with other institutions; (2) the classification of lay health workers who deliver study interventions as health providers or research participants; (3) the dilemma experienced by investigators when national standards seem to prohibit waivers of consent; (4) the timing of gatekeeper engagement, particularly when researchers face funding constraints; (5) providing ancillary care in health services or implementation trials when a routine care control arm is known to fall below national standards and (6) defining vulnerable participants needing protection in low-resource settings.}},

Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

abstract = {{Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web based survey and revised during a three day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).

METHODS:All Medline, Pubmed, and the Cochrane Library English articles on the educational impact of ATLS courses and their effects on trauma mortality for the period 1966-2012 were studied. All original articles written in English were included. Surveys, reviews, editorials/letters, and other trauma courses or models different from the ATLS course were excluded. Articles were critically evaluated regarding study research design, statistical analysis, outcome, and quality and level of evidence.

RESULTS:A total of 384 articles were found in the search. Of these, 104 relevant articles were read; 23 met the selection criteria and were critically analyzed. Ten original articles reported studies on the impact of ATLS on cognitive and clinical skills, six articles addressed the attrition of skills gained through ATLS training, and seven articles addressed the effects of ATLS on trauma mortality. There is level I evidence that ATLS significantly improves the knowledge of participants managing multiple trauma patients, their clinical skills, and their organization and priority approaches. There is level II-1 evidence that knowledge and skills gained through ATLS participation decline after 6 months, with a maximum decline after 2 years. Organization and priority skills, however, are kept for up to 8 years following ATLS. Strong evidence showing that ATLS training reduces morbidity and mortality in trauma patients is still lacking.

CONCLUSIONS:It is highly recommended that ATLS courses should be taught for all doctors who are involved in the management of multiple trauma patients. Future studies are required to properly evaluate the impact of ATLS training on trauma death rates and disability.}},

This study aimed to cluster patients with hyperkalemia on admission using unsupervised machine learning (ML) consensus clustering approach, and to compare characteristics and outcomes among these distinct clusters. Methods Consensus cluster analysis was performed in 5133 hospitalized adult patients with admission hyperkalemia, based on available clinical and laboratory data. The standardized mean difference was used to identify each cluster’s key clinical features. The association of hyperkalemia clusters with hospital and 1-year mortality was assessed using logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression. Results Three distinct clusters of hyperkalemia patients were identified using consensus cluster analysis: 1661 (32\%) in cluster 1, 2455 (48\%) in cluster 2 and 1017 (20\%) in cluster 3. Cluster 1 was mainly characterized by older age, higher serum chloride and acute kidney injury (AKI), but lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum bicarbonate and hemoglobin. Cluster 2 was mainly characterized by higher eGFR, serum bicarbonate and hemoglobin, but lower comorbidity burden, serum potassium and AKI. Cluster 3 was mainly characterized by higher comorbidity burden, particularly diabetes and end-stage kidney disease, AKI, serum potassium, anion gap, but lower eGFR, serum sodium, chloride and bicarbonate. Hospital and 1-year mortality risk was significantly different among the three identified clusters, with highest mortality in cluster 3, followed by cluster 1 and then cluster 2. Conclusion In a heterogeneous cohort of hyperkalemia patients, three distinct clusters were identified using unsupervised ML. These three clusters had different clinical characteristics and outcomes.}}

An ATLS provider demonstration course was delivered to 24 faculty surgeons and 15 Rwandan trauma nurse auditors, and a Canadian Network for International Surgery Trauma Team Training (TTT) course was delivered to 25 faculty, residents, and nurses. Trauma registry data over the 6\&nbsp;months prior to the courses were compared to the 6\&nbsp;months afterward with emergency department (ED) mortality as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included radiology utilization and early procedural interventions. Univariate analyses were conducted using χ 2 and Fisher’s exact test. A total of 798 and 575 patients were prospectively studied during the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods, respectively. Overall mortality of injured patients decreased after education implementation from 8.8 to 6.3\&nbsp;\%, but was not statistically significant (p\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;0.09). Patients with an initial Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3–8 had the highest injury-related mortality, which significantly decreased from 58.5\&nbsp;\% (n\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;55) to 37.1\&nbsp;\% (n\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;23), (p\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;0.009, OR 0.42, 95\&nbsp;\% CI 0.22–0.81). There was no statistical difference in the rates of early intubation, cervical collar use, imaging studies, or transfusion in the overall cohort or the head injury subset. When further stratified by GCS, patients with an initial GCS of 3–5 in the post-intervention period had higher utilization of head CT scans and chest X-rays. The mortality of severely injured patients decreased after initiation of focused trauma education courses, but no significant increase in resource utilization was observed. The explanation may be complex and multi-factorial. Long-term multidisciplinary efforts that pair training with changes in resources and mentorship may be needed to produce broad and lasting changes in the overall care system.}},

In this study ten filters were assessed through variable sample sizes over a 1-year period for cost and efficiency. Each filtered case was screened by trauma nurse coordinators. The trauma director reviewed possible deviations from standard and presented cases at peer review conferences for consensus on problem identification. While several filters had reasonable yield, most filters had minimal or no yield. Ten de novo problems were identified at a cost of \$1,100 per de novo problem. Six filters were modified based on common reasons for overfiltration, resulting in a substantial reduction in filtration rate without losing problem identification. We conclude that ACSCOT audit filters 1 (unexpected deaths), 4 (ICU LOS > twice the average), 5 (trauma surgeon response), and 9 (major surgery < 24 hours) have a reasonable yield. Filters 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 12 have limited value to an established suburban trauma center and are not cost effective. Modifications of these filters can reduce cost without obvious impact on effectiveness. Specific audit filters recommended for future study are presented.}},

Results from this study will inform the remainder of the project which will investigate the performance of a range of commonly used statistical methods, and create a repository of input parameters required for sample size calculation.</p><h3>Methods and analysis</h3> <p>We will collate 200 ITS studies evaluating public health interventions or the impact of exposures. ITS studies will be identified from a search of the bibliometric database PubMed between the years 2013 and 2017, combined with stratified random sampling. From eligible studies, we will extract study characteristics, details of the statistical models and estimation methods, effect metrics and parameter estimates. Further, we will extract the time series data when available. We will use systematic review methods in the screening, application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extraction of data. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the data.</p><h3>Ethics and dissemination</h3> <p>Ethics approval is not required since information will only be extracted from published studies.

abstract = {{Accurate and reliable criteria to rapidly estimate the probability of infection with the novel coronavirus-2 that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and associated disease (COVID-19) remain an urgent unmet need, especially in emergency care. The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction score for SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses simple criteria widely available at the point of care. Data came from the registry data from the national REgistry of suspected COVID-19 in EmeRgency care (RECOVER network) comprising 116 hospitals from 25 states in the US. Clinical variables and 30-day outcomes were abstracted from medical records of 19,850 emergency department (ED) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2. The criterion standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 required a positive molecular test from a swabbed sample or positive antibody testing within 30 days. The prediction score was derived from a 50\% random sample (n = 9,925) using unadjusted analysis of 107 candidate variables as a screening step, followed by stepwise forward logistic regression on 72 variables. Multivariable regression yielded a 13-variable score, which was simplified to a 13-point score: +1 point each for age>50 years, measured temperature>37.5°C, oxygen saturation<95\%, Black race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, household contact with known or suspected COVID-19, patient reported history of dry cough, anosmia/dysgeusia, myalgias or fever; and -1 point each for White race, no direct contact with infected person, or smoking. In the validation sample (n = 9,975), the probability from logistic regression score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.79–0.81), and this level of accuracy was retained across patients enrolled from the early spring to summer of 2020. In the simplified score, a score of zero produced a sensitivity of 95.6\% (94.8–96.3\%), specificity of 20.0\% (19.0–21.0\%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.22 (0.19–0.26). Increasing points on the simplified score predicted higher probability of infection (e.g., >75\% probability with +5 or more points). Criteria that are available at the point of care can accurately predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These criteria could assist with decisions about isolation and testing at high throughput checkpoints.}},

Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Visualization plays an important role in epidemic time series analysis and forecasting. Viewing time series data plotted on a graph can help researchers identify anomalies and unexpected trends that could be overlooked if the data were reviewed in tabular form; these details can influence a researcher's recommended course of action or choice of simulation models. However, there are challenges in reviewing data sets from multiple data sources - data can be aggregated in different ways (e.g., incidence vs. cumulative), measure different criteria (e.g., infection counts, hospitalizations, and deaths), or represent different geographical scales (e.g., nation, HHS Regions, or states), which can make a direct comparison between time series difficult. In the face of an emerging epidemic, the ability to visualize time series from various sources and organizations and to reconcile these datasets based on different criteria could be key in developing accurate forecasts and identifying effective interventions. Many tools have been developed for visualizing temporal data; however, none yet supports all the functionality needed for easy collaborative visualization and analysis of epidemic data.
RESULTS:In this paper, we present EpiViewer, a time series exploration dashboard where users can upload epidemiological time series data from a variety of sources and compare, organize, and track how data evolves as an epidemic progresses. EpiViewer provides an easy-to-use web interface for visualizing temporal datasets either as line charts or bar charts. The application provides enhanced features for visual analysis, such as hierarchical categorization, zooming, and filtering, to enable detailed inspection and comparison of multiple time series on a single canvas. Finally, EpiViewer provides several built-in statistical Epi-features to help users interpret the epidemiological curves.

CONCLUSION:EpiViewer is a single page web application that provides a framework for exploring, comparing, and organizing temporal datasets. It offers a variety of features for convenient filtering and analysis of epicurves based on meta-attribute tagging. EpiViewer also provides a platform for sharing data between groups for better comparison and analysis. Our user study demonstrated that EpiViewer is easy to use and fills a particular niche in the toolspace for visualization and exploration of epidemiological data.}},

We report the establishment of a trauma registry at the Adult Emergency and Trauma Centre (AETC) at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi and identify high risk geographic areas.
METHODS:We devised a paper based two-page trauma registry form. Ten data clerks and all AETC clinicians were trained to complete demographic and clinical details respectively. Descriptive data, regression and hotspot analyses were done using STATA 15 statistical package and ArcGIS (16) software respectively.

RESULTS:There were 3,747 patients from May 2013 to May 2015. The most common mechanisms of injury were assault (38.2\%), and road traffic injuries (31.6\%). The majority had soft tissue injury (53.1\%), while 23.8\% had no diagnosis indicated. Fractures (OR 19.94 [15.34-25.93]), head injury and internal organ injury (OR 29.5 [16.29-53.4]), and use of ambulance (OR 1.57 [1.06-2.33]) were found to be predictive of increased odds of being admitted to hospital while assault (OR 0.69 [0.52-0.91]) was found to be associated with less odds of being admitted to hospital. Hot spot analysis showed that at 99\% confidence interval, Ndirande, Mbayani and Limbe were the top hot spots for injury occurrence.

CONCLUSION:We have described the process of establishing an integrated and potentially sustainable trauma registry. Significant data were captured to provide details on the epidemiology of trauma and insight on how care could be improved at AETC and surrounding health facilities. This approach may be relevant in similar poor resource settings.}},

The aim of this methodological study was to describe how ITS designs were being used, the design characteristics, and reporting in the healthcare setting. We searched MEDLINE for reports of ITS designs published in 2015 which had a minimum of two data points collected pre-intervention and one post-intervention. There was no restriction on participants, language of study, or type of outcome. Data were summarised using appropriate summary statistics. One hundred and sixteen studies were included in the study. Interventions evaluated were mainly programs 41 (35\%) and policies 32 (28\%). Data were usually collected at monthly intervals, 74 (64\%). Of the 115 studies that reported an analysis, the most common method was segmented regression (78\%), 55\% considered autocorrelation, and only seven reported a sample size calculation. Estimation of intervention effects were reported as change in slope (84\%) and change in level (70\%) and 21\% reported long-term change in levels. This methodological study identified problems in the reporting of design features and results of ITS studies, and highlights the need for future work in the development of formal reporting guidelines and methodological work.}},

The Brier score has been recommended on the grounds that it is a proper scoring rule that is affected by both discrimination and calibration. However, the Brier score is prevalence dependent in such a way that the rank ordering of tests or models may inappropriately vary by prevalence. We explored four common clinical scenarios: comparison of a highly accurate binary test with a continuous prediction model of moderate predictiveness; comparison of two binary tests where the importance of sensitivity versus specificity is inversely associated with prevalence; comparison of models and tests to default strategies of assuming that all or no patients are positive; and comparison of two models with miscalibration in opposite directions. In each case, we found that the Brier score gave an inappropriate rank ordering of the tests and models. Conversely, net benefit, a decision-analytic measure, gave results that always favored the preferable test or model. Brier score does not evaluate clinical value of diagnostic tests or prediction models. We advocate, as an alternative, the use of decision-analytic measures such as net benefit. Not applicable.}},

abstract = {{<h3>Background</h3> <p>The Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and Risk Factors study used the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors. This paper provides an overview of injury estimates from the 2013 update of GBD, with detailed information on incidence, mortality, DALYs and rates of change from 1990 to 2013 for 26 causes of injury, globally, by region and by country.</p><h3>Methods</h3> <p>Injury mortality was estimated using the extensive GBD mortality database, corrections for ill-defined cause of death and the cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was based on inpatient and outpatient data sets, 26 cause-of-injury and 47 nature-of-injury categories, and seven follow-up studies with patient-reported long-term outcome measures.</p><h3>Results</h3> <p>In 2013, 973 million (uncertainty interval (UI) 942 to 993) people sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare and 4.8 million (UI 4.5 to 5.1) people died from injuries. Between 1990 and 2013 the global age-standardised injury DALY rate decreased by 31\% (UI 26\% to 35\%). The rate of decline in DALY rates was significant for 22 cause-of-injury categories, including all the major injuries.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3> <p>Injuries continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed and developing world. The decline in rates for almost all injuries is so prominent that it warrants a general statement that the world is becoming a safer place to live in. However, the patterns vary widely by cause, age, sex, region and time and there are still large improvements that need to be made.</p>}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Nonoperative management (NOM) has become more common in hemodynamically stable patients with high-grade blunt splenic injury. However, there are no widely accepted guidelines for an optimal and safe timeframe for the initiation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the timing of VTE prophylaxis initiation and NOM failure rate in isolated high-grade blunt splenic injury.
METHODS:We utilized the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database (2013-2014) to identify adult patients who underwent NOM for isolated high-grade blunt splenic injuries (grades 3-5). The incidence of NOM failure after the initiation of VTE prophylaxis was compared between two groups: VTE prophylaxis <48 h after admission (early prophylaxis group), and ≥48 h (late prophylaxis group).

RESULTS:A total of 816 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of those, VTE prophylaxis was not administered in 525 patients (64.3\%), whereas VTE prophylaxis was given <48 h and ≥48 h after admission in 144 and 147 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in the NOM failure rate after the initiation of VTE prophylaxis between the early and late prophylaxis groups (3.5\% versus 3.4\%, P = 1.00). In the multiple logistic regression analysis, early initiation of VTE prophylaxis was not significantly associated with NOM failure (OR: 1.32, 95\% CI 0.35-4.93, P = 0.68).

CONCLUSIONS:The results of our study suggest that early initiation of VTE prophylaxis (<48 h) does not increase the risk of NOM failure in patients with isolated high-grade blunt splenic injury.}},

Currently, there is no globally recognized, standard curriculum that defines the basic minimum standards for specialist trainees in emergency medicine. To address this deficit, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM) convened a committee of international physicians, health professionals, and other experts in emergency medicine and international emergency medicine development to outline a curriculum for training of specialists in emergency medicine. This curriculum document represents the consensus of recommendations by this committee. The curriculum is designed to provide a framework for educational programs in emergency medicine. The focus is on the basic minimum emergency medicine educational content that any emergency medicine physician specialist should be prepared to deliver on completion of a training program. It is designed not to be prescriptive but to assist educators and emergency medicine leadership to advance physician education in basic emergency medicine no matter the training venue. The content of this curriculum is relevant not just for communities with mature emergency medicine systems but in particular for developing nations or for nations seeking to expand emergency medicine within the current educational structure. We anticipate that there will be wide variability in how this curriculum is implemented and taught. This variability will reflect the existing educational milieu, the resources available, and the goals of the institutions' educational leadership with regard to the training of emergency medicine specialists.}},

This article discusses the use of QIs in the care of trauma patients. A series of QIs were originally promulgated by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) and have been investigated for their utility in measuring quality in trauma systems by a number of US based studies. While some have advocated the implementation of several specific indicators, others have recommended discontinued use of a range of proposed QIs. This review highlights the difficulties of meeting these ideal indicator requirements in trauma care and proposes that the development of alternative indicators may provide more useful measures of quality care.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.
METHODS:In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.

FINDINGS:Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49\%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51\%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83\%] patients), cough (81 [82\%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31\%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11\%] patients), confusion (nine [9\%] patients), headache (eight [8\%] patients), sore throat (five [5\%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4\%] patients), chest pain (two [2\%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2\%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1\%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75\%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14\%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1\%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17\%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11\%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.

INTERPRETATION:The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

Evaluation is often described as having one or more of three purposes: to establish or clarify program effectiveness; to improve program implementation; and to address administrative needs. Logic or causal models suggest where to intervene. Subsequently, it is helpful to have the specific implementation intervention strategies developed on the basis of conceptual planning models. The level (practice, organization, and/or community) at which the intervention is applied, plays a major part in dictating the design of the evaluation. The chapter discusses two broad categories to describe evaluation: process evaluation and outcome evaluation. The chapter summarizes the Seattle, Washington area bicycle safety helmet campaign and the statewide childhood injury prevention program (SCIPP) in Massachusetts to demonstrate some of the choices entailed in selecting process and outcome measures.}},

In this study ten filters were assessed through variable sample sizes over a 1-year period for cost and efficiency. Each filtered case was screened by trauma nurse coordinators. The trauma director reviewed possible deviations from standard and presented cases at peer review conferences for consensus on problem identification. While several filters had reasonable yield, most filters had minimal or no yield. Ten de novo problems were identified at a cost of +1,000 per de novo problem. Six filters were modified based on common reasons for overfiltration, resulting in a substantial reduction in filtration rate without losing problem identification. We conclude that ACSCOT audit filters 1 (unexpected deaths), 4 (ICU LOS greater than twice the average), 5 (trauma surgeon response), and 9 (major surgery greater than 24 hours) have a reasonable yield. Filters 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 12 have limited value to an established suburban trauma center and are not cost effective. Modifications of these filters can reduce cost without obvious impact on effectiveness. Specific audit filters recommended for future study are presented.}},

abstract = {{Studies of trends in population changes and epidemiological profiles in the developing world have overwhelmingly relied upon the concepts of demographic, epidemiological, and health transitions, even though their usefulness in describing and understanding population and health trends in developing countries has been repeatedly called into question. The issue is particularly relevant for the study of population health patterns in Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, as the history and experience there differs substantially from that of Western Europe and North America, for which these concepts were originally developed. The aim of this study is two-fold: to review and clarify any distinction between the concepts of demographic transition, epidemiological transition and health transition and to identify summary indicators of population health to test how well these concepts apply in Africa. Notwithstanding the characteristically diverse African context, Africa is a continent of uncertainties and emergencies where discontinuities and interruptions of health, disease, and mortality trends reflect the enduring fragility and instability of countries and the vulnerabilities of individuals and populations in the continent. Africa as a whole remains the furthest behind the world's regions in terms of health improvements and longevity, as do its sub-Saharan African regions and societies specifically. This study documents: 1) theoretically and empirically the similarities and differences between the demographic transition, epidemiological transition, and health transition; 2) simple summary indicators that can be used to evaluate their descriptive and predictive features; 3) marked disparities in the onset and pace of variations and divergent trends in health, disease, and mortality patterns as well as fertility and life expectancy trajectories among African countries and regions over the past 60 years; 4) the rapid decline in infant mortality and gains in life expectancy from the 1950s through the 1990s in a context of preponderant communicable diseases in all African countries; 5) the salient role of adult mortality, mostly ascribed to HIV/AIDS and co-morbidities, since the 1990s in reversing trends in mortality decline, its interruption of life expectancy improvements, and its reversal of gender differences in life expectancies disadvantaging women in several countries with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS; 6) the huge impact of wars in reversing the trends in under-five mortality decline in sub-Saharan countries in the 1990s and beyond. These assessments of these transition frameworks and these phenomena were not well documented to date for all five regions and 57 countries of Africa. Prevailing frameworks of demographic, epidemiological, and health transitions as descriptive and predictive models are incomplete or irrelevant for charting the population and health experiences and prospects of national populations in the African context.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Physician burnout has reached epidemic levels, as documented in national studies of both physicians in training and practising physicians. The consequences are negative effects on patient care, professionalism, physicians' own care and safety, and the viability of health-care systems. A more complete understanding than at present of the quality and outcomes of the literature on approaches to prevent and reduce burnout is necessary.
METHODS:In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Education Resources Information Center from inception to Jan 15, 2016, for studies of interventions to prevent and reduce physician burnout, including single-arm pre-post comparison studies. We required studies to provide physician-specific burnout data using burnout measures with validity support from commonly accepted sources of evidence. We excluded studies of medical students and non-physician health-care providers. We considered potential eligibility of the abstracts and extracted data from eligible studies using a standardised form. Outcomes were changes in overall burnout, emotional exhaustion score (and high emotional exhaustion), and depersonalisation score (and high depersonalisation). We used random-effects models to calculate pooled mean difference estimates for changes in each outcome.

FINDINGS:We identified 2617 articles, of which 15 randomised trials including 716 physicians and 37 cohort studies including 2914 physicians met inclusion criteria. Overall burnout decreased from 54\% to 44\% (difference 10\% [95\% CI 5-14]; p<0·0001; I(2)=15\%; 14 studies), emotional exhaustion score decreased from 23·82 points to 21·17 points (2·65 points [1·67-3·64]; p<0·0001; I(2)=82\%; 40 studies), and depersonalisation score decreased from 9·05 to 8·41 (0·64 points [0·15-1·14]; p=0·01; I(2)=58\%; 36 studies). High emotional exhaustion decreased from 38\% to 24\% (14\% [11-18]; p<0·0001; I(2)=0\%; 21 studies) and high depersonalisation decreased from 38\% to 34\% (4\% [0-8]; p=0·04; I(2)=0\%; 16 studies).

INTERPRETATION:The literature indicates that both individual-focused and structural or organisational strategies can result in clinically meaningful reductions in burnout among physicians. Further research is needed to establish which interventions are most effective in specific populations, as well as how individual and organisational solutions might be combined to deliver even greater improvements in physician wellbeing than those achieved with individual solutions.

abstract = {{ATLS is at a crossroads in its development The family tragedy in 1976 gave birth to the trauma legend known as ATLS. In that year a plane piloted by the orthopaedic surgeon J Styner crashed in Nebraska. His wife was killed and four children seriously injured. Unfortunately for Dr Styner he found that the subsequent care received in the local hospital was inferior to what he was able to provide for 10 hours at the scene of the accident. In the ensuing inquiry the need to train clinicians in trauma care became evident.1 Using the educational structure of the recently developed ACLS programme, the first ATLS course was run in Nebraska in 1978. The following year it was taken up by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS COT) and rapidly spread throughout the North, Central, and South America. Today ATLS is taught in over 42 countries and around half a million clinicians have completed the course (I Hughes, personal communication). In the UK alone over 13 000 providers and 3000 instructors have been trained since its arrival in 1988 (S Dilgert, personnel communication). As Nolan says in his article, ATLS originally represented a state of the art training course on the care of major trauma.2 Its new and refreshing educational format made it accessible to all clinicians dealing with trauma in the resuscitation room. The reason for this was that it incorporated clear clinical principles that underpin the course. These have not changed in 28 years: These principles became translated into the now famous structured approach to trauma care. With even …}},

These specialists share a common practice space and similar shift work schedules. Together they govern decisions about use of the most expensive care setting in medicine--the hospital.
DISCUSSION:Unfortunately, in most institutions there is little collaboration between emergency physicians and hospitalists, resulting in missed opportunities to improve the quality of care and reduce its cost. In this call to action, we challenge emergency physicians and hospitalists to work together to develop protocols for consistent, evidence-based, and expeditious care of patients admitted from the ED; to collaborate in the care of ED patients who can safely be discharged home; to pursue joint quality, hospital leadership, and cost-effectiveness projects; to work in partnership to assure adequate staffing of hospital-based specialists; and to cooperate in the professional, front-line assessment of clinically and fiscally driven policies aimed at assessing the appropriateness of hospital admissions and readmissions.

SUMMARY:Hospital care is increasingly driven by emergency physicians and hospitalists. We envision a vital role for ongoing collaboration between them in achieving the goals of patient care, education, and quality and safety outcomes.}},

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:Because open surgical skills training for trauma is limited in clinical practice, trauma skills training courses were developed to fill this gap, The aim of this report is to find supporting evidence for efficacy of these courses. The questions addressed are: What courses are available and is there robust evidence of benefit?
DESIGN:We performed a systematic review of the training course literature on open trauma surgery procedural skills courses for surgeons using Kirkpatrick's framework for evaluating complex educational interventions. Courses were identified using Pubmed, Google Scholar and other databases.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:The review was carried out at the University of Maryland, Baltimore with input from civilian and military trauma surgeons, all of whom have taught and/or developed trauma skills courses.

RESULTS:We found 32 course reports that met search criteria, including 21 trauma-skills training courses. Courses were of variable duration, content, cost and scope. There were no prospective randomized clinical trials of course impact. Efficacy for most courses was with Kirkpatrick level 1 and 2 evidence of benefit by self-evaluations, and reporting small numbers of respondents. Few courses assessed skill retention with longitudinal data before and after training. Three courses, namely: Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), Advanced Surgical Skills for Exposure in Trauma (ASSET) and Advanced Trauma Operative Management (ATOM) have Kirkpatrick's level 2-3 evidence for efficacy. Components of these 3 courses are included in several other courses, but many skills courses have little published evidence of training efficacy or skills retention durability.

CONCLUSIONS:Large variations in course content, duration, didactics, operative models, resource requirements and cost suggest that standardization of content, duration, and development of metrics for open surgery skills would be beneficial, as would translation into improved trauma patient outcomes. Surgeons at all levels of training and experience should participate in these trauma skills courses, because these procedures are rarely performed in routine clinical practice. Faculty running courses without evidence of training benefit should be encouraged to study outcomes to show their course improves technical skills and subsequently patient outcomes. Obtaining Kirkpatrick's level 3 and 4 evidence for benefits of ASSET, ATOM, ATLS and for other existing courses should be a high priority.}},

Machine learning (ML) can enhance the prediction of outcomes through classification techniques that classify the data into predetermined categories. The aim of this study is to present an evaluation and comparison of how machine learning techniques can be applied on medical records of cardiorespiratory fitness and how the various techniques differ in terms of capabilities of predicting medical outcomes (e.g. mortality).
METHODS:We use data of 34,212 patients free of known coronary artery disease or heart failure who underwent clinician-referred exercise treadmill stress testing at Henry Ford Health Systems Between 1991 and 2009 and had a complete 10-year follow-up. Seven machine learning classification techniques were evaluated: Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naïve Bayesian Classifier (BC), Bayesian Network (BN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). In order to handle the imbalanced dataset used, the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used.

RESULTS:Two set of experiments have been conducted with and without the SMOTE sampling technique. On average over different evaluation metrics, SVM Classifier has shown the lowest performance while other models like BN, BC and DT performed better. The RF classifier has shown the best performance (AUC = 0.97) among all models trained using the SMOTE sampling.

CONCLUSIONS:The results show that various ML techniques can significantly vary in terms of its performance for the different evaluation metrics. It is also not necessarily that the more complex the ML model, the more prediction accuracy can be achieved. The prediction performance of all models trained with SMOTE is much better than the performance of models trained without SMOTE. The study shows the potential of machine learning methods for predicting all-cause mortality using cardiorespiratory fitness data.}},

It is common to extend the use of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) audit filters to this scope. This mandates that their actual link with outcome be demonstrated. Several studies attempted to do so, but with inconsistent risk-adjustment, conflicting results and never using long-term disability as outcome measure, despite its recognised importance. We tried to overcome these limitations.MethodsRisk-adjusted analysis of the association of filters 1, 3, 10 and 13 with 30-day mortality and 6-month disability measured with the EQ5D scale. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used respectively. The data came from a National Italian Trauma Registry comprising 838 patients with major trauma.ResultsThree (1, 3 and 10) of the filters analysed did not show any significant association with either outcome. Filter 13 was associated with decreased mortality and lower (worse) disability scores.ConclusionsMethodological difficulties, incomplete, obsolete or non-generalisable definitions of some filters can explain the generally poor correlation with outcomes. The conflicting association of filter 13 with the two types of outcomes raises some interesting questions about the targeted outcomes in trauma research.It is recommended that further studies develop better quality indicators and test their link with both survival and functional outcome in the same setting where they are applied for assessment and comparison of trauma care.}},

It is characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infections that results in life-threatening organ dysfunction and even death. Bacterial cell wall components (endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide), known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), as well as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by host injured cells, are well-recognized triggers resulting in the elevation of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Understanding this complex pathophysiology has led to the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring a balanced immune response by eliminating/deactivating these inflammatory mediators. Different extracorporeal techniques have been studied in recent years in the hope of maximizing the effect of renal replacement therapy in modulating the exaggerated host inflammatory response, including the use of high volume hemofiltration (HVHF), high cut-off (HCO) membranes, adsorption alone, and coupled plasma filtration adsorption (CPFA). These strategies are not widely utilized in practice, depending on resources and local expertise. The literature examining their use in septic patients is growing, but the evidence to support their use at this stage is considered of low level. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the technical aspects, clinical applications, and associated side effects of these techniques.}},

title = {{A guide to using the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change to investigate implementation problems.}},
doi = {10.1186/s13012-017-0605-9},
abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Implementing new practices requires changes in the behaviour of relevant actors, and this is facilitated by understanding of the determinants of current and desired behaviours. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was developed by a collaboration of behavioural scientists and implementation researchers who identified theories relevant to implementation and grouped constructs from these theories into domains. The collaboration aimed to provide a comprehensive, theory-informed approach to identify determinants of behaviour. The first version was published in 2005, and a subsequent version following a validation exercise was published in 2012. This guide offers practical guidance for those who wish to apply the TDF to assess implementation problems and support intervention design. It presents a brief rationale for using a theoretical approach to investigate and address implementation problems, summarises the TDF and its development, and describes how to apply the TDF to achieve implementation objectives. Examples from the implementation research literature are presented to illustrate relevant methods and practical considerations.
METHODS:Researchers from Canada, the UK and Australia attended a 3-day meeting in December 2012 to build an international collaboration among researchers and decision-makers interested in the advancing use of the TDF. The participants were experienced in using the TDF to assess implementation problems, design interventions, and/or understand change processes. This guide is an output of the meeting and also draws on the authors' collective experience. Examples from the implementation research literature judged by authors to be representative of specific applications of the TDF are included in this guide.

RESULTS:We explain and illustrate methods, with a focus on qualitative approaches, for selecting and specifying target behaviours key to implementation, selecting the study design, deciding the sampling strategy, developing study materials, collecting and analysing data, and reporting findings of TDF-based studies. Areas for development include methods for triangulating data, e.g. from interviews, questionnaires and observation and methods for designing interventions based on TDF-based problem analysis.

CONCLUSIONS:We offer this guide to the implementation community to assist in the application of the TDF to achieve implementation objectives. Benefits of using the TDF include the provision of a theoretical basis for implementation studies, good coverage of potential reasons for slow diffusion of evidence into practice and a method for progressing from theory-based investigation to intervention.}},

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Data was collected from STBI patients admitted to the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital between December 2009 and November 2011. Twenty-two machine learning (ML) models were tested, and their predictive performance compared with logistic regression (LR) model. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC), area under curve (AUC), accuracy, F-score, precision, recall and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) were used as performance metrics.

RESULTS:A total of 117 patients were enrolled. AUC of all ML models ranged from 86.3\% to 94\%. AUC of LR was 83\%, and accuracy was 88\%. The AUC of Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM and Linear SVM were higher than that of LR. The precision ratio of LR was 95\% and recall ratio was 91\%, both were lower than most ML models. The F-Score of LR was 0.93, which was only slightly better than that of Linear Discriminant and Quadratic Discriminant.

CONCLUSIONS:The twenty-two ML models selected have capabilities comparable to classical LR model for outcome prediction in STBI patients. Of these, Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Linear SVM performed significantly better than LR.}},

Temperatures were displayed graphically, assessed for normality, and analyzed using paired comparisons. Automatically-recorded temperatures were obtained from several monitoring sites. Provider-entered temperatures were non-normally distributed, exhibiting peaks at temperatures at multiples of 0.5 °C. Automatically-acquired temperatures, on the other hand, were more normally distributed, demonstrating smoother curves without peaks at multiples of 0.5 °C. Automatically-acquired median temperature was highest, 36.8 °C (SD = 0.8 °C), followed by the three manually acquired temperatures (nurse-documented postoperative temperature, 36.5 °C [SD = 0.6 °C]; intraoperative manual temperature, 36.5 °C [SD = 0.6 °C]; provider-documented postoperative temperature, 36.1 °C [SD = 0.6 °C]). Provider-entered temperatures exhibit values that are unlikely to represent a normal probability distribution around a central physiologic value. Manually-entered perioperative temperatures appear to cluster around salient anchoring values, either deliberately, or as an unintended result driven by cognitive bias.

abstract = {{Mortality prediction aids clinical decision-making and is necessary for quality improvement initiatives. Validated metrics rely on pre-specified variables and often require advanced diagnostics which are unfeasible in resource-constrained contexts. We hypothesize that machine learning will generate superior mortality prediction in both high-income and low and middle-income country cohorts.
METHODS:SuperLearner(SL), an ensemble machine-learning algorithm, was applied to data from three prospective trauma cohorts: a highest-activation cohort in the United States(US), a high-volume center cohort in South Africa(SA), and a multicenter registry in Cameroon. Cross-validation was used to assess model discrimination of discharge mortality by site using receiver operating characteristic curves. SuperLearner discrimination was compared with standard scoring methods. Clinical variables driving SL prediction at each site were evaluated.

RESULTS:Data from 28,212 injured patients were used to generate prediction. Discharge mortality was 17\%, 1.3\%, and 1.7\% among US, SA, and Cameroonian cohorts. SL delivered superior prediction of discharge mortality in the US (AUC 94-97\%) and vastly superior prediction in Cameroon (AUC 90-94\%) compared to conventional scoring algorithms. It provided similar prediction to standard scores in the SA cohort (AUC 90-95\%). Context-specific variables (partial thromboplastin time in the US and hospital distance in Cameroon) were prime drivers of predicted mortality in their respective cohorts, while severe brain injury predicted mortality across sites.

CONCLUSIONS:Machine learning provides excellent discrimination of injury mortality in diverse settings. Unlike traditional scores, data-adaptive methods are well-suited to optimizing precise site-specific prediction regardless of diagnostic capabilities or dataset inclusion allowing for individualized decision-making and expanded access to quality improvement programming.

We searched PubMed, CINAHL and World Health Organization (WHO) databases for reports describing facility-based emergency care and obtained unpublished data from a network of clinicians and researchers. We screened articles for inclusion based on their titles and abstracts in English or French. We extracted data on patient outcomes and demographics as well as facility and provider characteristics. Analyses were restricted to reports published from 1990 onwards.Findings We identified 195 reports concerning 192 facilities in 59 countries. Most were academically-affiliated hospitals in urban areas. The median mortality within emergency departments was 1.8\% (interquartile range, IQR: 0.2-5.1\%). Mortality was relatively high in paediatric facilities (median: 4.8\%; IQR: 2.3-8.4\%) and in sub-Saharan Africa (median: 3.4\%; IQR: 0.5-6.3\%). The median number of patients was 30 000 per year (IQR: 10 296-60 000), most of whom were young (median age: 35 years; IQR: 6.9-41.0) and male (median: 55.7\%; IQR: 50.0-59.2\%). Most facilities were staffed either by physicians-in-training or by physicians whose level of training was unspecified. Very few of these providers had specialist training in emergency care.Conclusion Available data on emergency care in LMICs indicate high patient loads and mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where a substantial proportion of all deaths may occur in emergency departments. The combination of high volume and the urgency of treatment make emergency care an important area of focus for interventions aimed at reducing mortality in these settings.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures.
METHODS:We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography-year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).

FINDINGS:Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95\% uncertainty interval 61·4-61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5-72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7-17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5-70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1\% (2·6-5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0\% (15·8-18·1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1\% (12·6-16·0) to 39·8 million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1\% (11·9-14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1\%, 39·1-44·6), malaria (43·1\%, 34·7-51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8\%, 24·8-34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1\%, 19·3-37·1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000-183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000-532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death.

INTERPRETATION:At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

Methods We prospectively enrolled all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in our ED from March 9, 2020 to April 4, 2020. We abstracted medical history, physical examination findings, and the clinical probability of COVID-19 (“low”, “moderate”, “high”) rated by emergency physicians depending on their clinical judgment. We assessed diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+/LR-). Results We included 391 patients of whom 225 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR was more likely to be negative when the emergency physician thought that clinical probability was low, and more likely to be positive when she or he thought that clinical probability was high. Patient-reported anosmia and the presence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound had the highest LR+ for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (7.58; 95\% CI 2.36–24.36 and 7.09; 95\% CI 2.77–18.12 respectively). The absence of a high clinical probability determined by the emergency physician and the absence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound had the lowest LR- for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (0.33; 95\% CI 0.25–0.43 and 0.26; 95\% CI 0.15–0.45 respectively). Conclusions Anosmia, emergency physician estimate of high clinical probability and bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound increased the likelihood of identifying COVID-19 in patients presenting to the ED.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Strategies for ordering bedside chest radiographs (CXRs) have substantial logistic and financial consequences in the ICU. Many of the indications for CXRs in the ICU are controversial, such as the ordering of daily routine CXRs for intubated patients. The opinions of intensivists about ordering CXRs have not been reported. Comparing these opinions to established guidelines and identifying situations where opinions diverge in the absence of guidelines are of considerable interest.
METHODS:We asked 190 intensivists from 34 ICUs in the area of Paris, France, to anonymously complete a 29-item questionnaire about their opinions regarding the ordering of CXRs; each item described a clinical scenario. Of the 29 scenarios, 10 dealt with the placement of medical devices, 8 with the presence of medical devices, and 11 with other clinical situations. The study was based on a Delphi process deployed over the Internet through an original software application. Three Delphi rounds were run between January and March 2006, using the same questionnaire. Detailed feedback for the answers given during the previous round was supplied to each intensivist solicited for updating his answers.

RESULTS:Eighty-two intensivists from 32 ICUs completed the study. A consensus emerged that routine CXRs were necessary for eight scenarios and unnecessary for two scenarios. The study also shed light on items without a consensus. In particular, 75\% of intensivists (58\% on the first round) did not support obtaining daily routine CXRs in intubated patients.

CONCLUSION:The study underlines situations in which intensivists do not support the guidelines and outlines recommendations likely to be followed in clinical practice.}},

We examined the association between physician sex and 30-day mortality and readmission rates, adjusted for patient and physician characteristics and hospital fixed effects (effectively comparing female and male physicians within the same hospital). As a sensitivity analysis, we examined only physicians focusing on hospital care (hospitalists), among whom patients are plausibly quasi-randomized to physicians based on the physician’s specific work schedules.

We sought to explore opportunities to improve trauma QI activities in LMIC, focusing on the Asia–Pacific region. We performed a mixed methods research study using both inductive thematic analysis of a meeting convened at the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, Melbourne, Australia, November 21–22, 2010 and a pre-meeting survey to explore experiences with trauma QI activities in LMIC. Purposive sampling was employed to invite participants with demonstrated leadership in trauma care to provide diverse representation of organizations and countries within Asia–Pacific. A total of 22 experts participated in the meeting and reported that trauma QI activities varied between countries and organizations: morbidity and mortality conferences (56 \%), monitoring complications (31 \%), preventable death studies (25 \%), audit filters (19 \%), and statistical methods for analyzing morbidity and mortality (6 \%). Participants identified QI gaps to include paucity of reliable/valid injury data, lack of integrated trauma QI activities, absence of standards of care, lack of training in QI methods, and varying cultures of quality and safety. The group highlighted barriers to QI: limited engagement of leaders, organizational diversity, limited resources, heavy clinical workload, and medico-legal concerns. Participants proposed establishing the Asia–Pacific Trauma Quality Improvement Network (APTQIN) as a tool to facilitate training and dissemination of QI methods, injury data management, development of pilot QI projects, and advocacy for quality trauma care. Our study provides the first description of trauma QI practices, gaps in existing practices, and barriers to QI in LMIC of the Asia–Pacific region. In this study we identified opportunities for addressing these challenges, and that work will be supported by APTQIN.}},

While traditional telemetry systems can provide real-time continuous vital signs, they are too expensive for widespread use in these settings. At the same time, developed countries such as the United States have been increasingly utilizing remote monitoring systems to shift patient care from hospital to home. While the context is dramatically different, the challenge of monitoring patients in otherwise unmonitored settings is the same. At-home monitoring solutions range from highly comprehensive and expensive systems to inexpensive fitness trackers. In the field of global health, the adoption of this technology has been somewhat limited. We believe that low cost fitness trackers present an opportunity to address the challenge of vital sign monitoring in resource-poor settings at a fraction of the cost of existing technical solutions.}},

Multiple statistical methods are available to analyse data from ITS studies, but no empirical investigation has examined how the different methods compare when applied to real-world datasets. A random sample of 200 ITS studies identified in a previous methods review were included. Time series data from each of these studies was sought. Each dataset was re-analysed using six statistical methods. Point and confidence interval estimates for level and slope changes, standard errors, p-values and estimates of autocorrelation were compared between methods. From the 200 ITS studies, including 230 time series, 190 datasets were obtained. We found that the choice of statistical method can importantly affect the level and slope change point estimates, their standard errors, width of confidence intervals and p-values. Statistical significance (categorised at the 5\% level) often differed across the pairwise comparisons of methods, ranging from 4 to 25\% disagreement. Estimates of autocorrelation differed depending on the method used and the length of the series. The choice of statistical method in ITS studies can lead to substantially different conclusions about the impact of the interruption. Pre-specification of the statistical method is encouraged, and naive conclusions based on statistical significance should be avoided.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Between 1990 and 2015, the global injury mortality declined, but in countries where the poorest billion live, injuries are becoming an increasingly prevalent cause of death. The vulnerability of this population requires immediate attention from policy makers to implement effective interventions that lessen the burden of injuries in these countries. Our aim was two-fold; first, to review all the evidence on effective interventions for the five main types of unintentional injury; and second, to estimate the potential number of lives saved by effective injury interventions among the poorest billion.
METHODS:For our systematic review we used references in the Disability Control Priorities third edition, and searched PubMed and the Cochrane database for papers published until Sept 10, 2016, using a comprehensive search strategy to find interventions for the five major causes of unintentional injuries: road traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns, and poisoning. Studies were included if they presented evidence with significant effects sizes for any outcome; no inclusions or exclusions made on the basis of where the study was carried out (ie, low-income, middle-income, or high-income country). Then we used data from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study and a Monte Carlo simulation technique to estimate the potential annual attributable number of lives saved among the poorest billion by these evidence-based injury interventions. We estimated results for 84 countries where the poorest billion live.

FINDINGS:From the 513 papers identified, 47 were eligible for inclusion. We identified 11 interventions that had an effect on injury mortality. For road traffic deaths, the most successful interventions in preventing deaths are speed enforcement (>80 000 lives saved per year) and drink-driving enforcement (>60 000 lives saved per year). Interventions potentially most effective in preventing deaths from drowning are formal swimming lessons for children younger than 14 years (>25 000 lives saved per year) and the use of crèches to supervise younger children (younger than 5 years; >10 000 lives saved per year). We did not find sufficient evidence on interventions for other causes of unintentional injuries (poisoning, burns, and falls) to run similar simulations.

INTERPRETATION:Based on the little available evidence, key interventions have been identified to prevent lives lost from unintentional injuries among the poorest billion. This Article provides guidance to national authorities on evidence-based priority interventions that can reduce the burden of injuries among the most vulnerable members of the population. We also identify an important gap in knowledge on the effectiveness and the mortality impacts of injury interventions.

The developed framework provides valuable insights in how to organise the complexity involved in studying the health effects resulting from globalisation. It could, therefore, give a meaningful contribution to further empirical research by serving as a 'think-model' and provides a basis for the development of future scenarios on health.}},

abstract = {{PURPOSE:To assess the accuracy of bedside findings for diagnosing coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS:A MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve articles published from January 1966 to January 2003 that were relevant to the bedside diagnosis of coronary disease in adults.

RESULTS:In patients with stable, intermittent chest pain, the most useful bedside predictors for a diagnosis of coronary disease were found to be the presence of typical angina (likelihood ratio [LR]=5.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2 to 7.8), serum cholesterol level >300 mg/dL (LR=4.0; 95\% CI: 2.5 to 6.3), history of prior myocardial infarction (LR=3.8; 95\% CI: 2.1 to 6.8), and age >70 years (LR=2.6; 95\% CI: 1.8 to 4.0). Nonanginal chest pain (LR=0.1; 95\% CI: 0.1 to 0.2), pain duration >30 minutes (LR=0.1; 95\% CI: 0.0 to 0.9), and intermittent dysphagia (LR=0.2; 95\% CI: 0.1 to 0.8) argued against a diagnosis of coronary disease. In patients with acute chest pain, the most important bedside predictors for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction were new ST elevation (LR=22; 95\% CI: 16 to 30), new Q waves (LR=22; 95\% CI: 7.6 to 62), and new ST depression (LR=4.5; 95\% CI: 3.6 to 5.6). A normal electrocardiogram (LR=0.2; 95\% CI: 0.1 to 0.3), chest wall tenderness (LR=0.3; 95\% CI: 0.2 to 0.4), and pain that was pleuritic (LR=0.2; 95\% CI: 0.2 to 0.3), sharp (LR=0.3; 95\% CI: 0.2 to 0.5), or positional (LR=0.3; 95\% CI: 0.2 to 0.5) argued against the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

CONCLUSION:The accuracy of bedside predictors depends on the clinical setting. In the evaluation of stable, intermittent chest pain, a patient's description of pain was found to be the most important predictor of underlying coronary disease. In the evaluation of acute chest pain, the electrocardiogram was the most useful bedside predictor for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Aside from the extremes in cholesterol values, the analysis of traditional risk factors changed the probability of coronary disease or myocardial infarction very little or not at all.}},

Despite progress identifying risk factors, limited research has examined how to combine variables into an optimized post-earthquake PTSD prediction tool that could be used to triage survivors to mental health services. The current study developed a post-earthquake PTSD risk score using machine learning methods designed to optimize prediction. The data were from a two-wave survey of Chileans exposed to the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in February 2010. Respondents (n = 23,907) were interviewed roughly three months prior to and again three months after the earthquake. Probable post-earthquake PTSD was assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale. We applied super learning, an ensembling machine learning method, to develop the PTSD risk score from 67 risk factors that could be assessed within one week of earthquake occurrence. The super learner algorithm had better cross-validated performance than the 39 individual algorithms from which it was developed, including conventional logistic regression. The super learner also had a better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.79) than existing post-disaster PTSD risk tools. Individuals in the top 5\%, 10\%, and 20\% of the predicted risk distribution accounted for 17.5\%, 32.2\%, and 51.4\% of all probable cases of PTSD, respectively. In addition to developing a risk score that could be implemented in the near future, these results more broadly support the utility of super learning to develop optimized prediction functions for mental health outcomes.}},

However, the equation describing the relationship between predictors and outcome is often complex and the computation requires software for practical use. There is another method called nomogram which is a graphical calculating device allowing an approximate graphical computation of a mathematical function. In this article, we describe how to draw nomograms for various outcomes with nomogram() function. Binary outcome is fit by logistic regression model and the outcome of interest is the probability of the event of interest. Ordinal outcome variable is also discussed. Survival analysis can be fit with parametric model to fully describe the distributions of survival time. Statistics such as the median survival time, survival probability up to a specific time point are taken as the outcome of interest.}},

This Series paper focuses on the direct (due to violence) and indirect health effects of armed conflict on women and children (including adolescents) worldwide. We estimate that nearly 36 million children and 16 million women were displaced in 2017, on the basis of international databases of refugees and internally displaced populations. From geospatial analyses we estimate that the number of non-displaced women and children living dangerously close to armed conflict (within 50 km) increased from 185 million women and 250 million children in 2000, to 265 million women and 368 million children in 2017. Women's and children's mortality risk from non-violent causes increases substantially in response to nearby conflict, with more intense and more chronic conflicts leading to greater mortality increases. More than 10 million deaths in children younger than 5 years can be attributed to conflict between 1995 and 2015 globally. Women of reproductive ages living near high intensity conflicts have three times higher mortality than do women in peaceful settings. Current research provides fragmentary evidence about how armed conflict indirectly affects the survival chances of women and children through malnutrition, physical injuries, infectious diseases, poor mental health, and poor sexual and reproductive health, but major systematic evidence is sparse, hampering the design and implementation of essential interventions for mitigating the harms of armed conflicts.}},

Assessing LMIC trauma systems supports their improvement. Evaluating systems using a Three Delays framework, considering barriers to seeking (Delay 1), reaching (Delay 2) and receiving care (Delay 3), has aided maternal health gains. Rapid assessments allow timely appraisal within resource and logistically constrained settings. We systematically reviewed existing literature on the assessment of LMIC trauma systems, applying the Three Delays framework and rapid assessment principles. We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis of articles assessing LMIC trauma systems. We searched seven databases and grey literature for studies and reports published until October 2018. Inclusion criteria were an injury care focus and assessment of at least one defined system aspect. We mapped each study to the Three Delays framework and judged its suitability for rapid assessment. Of 14 677 articles identified, 111 studies and 8 documents were included. Sub-Saharan Africa was the most commonly included region (44.1\%). Delay 3, either alone or in combination, was most commonly assessed (79.3\%) followed by Delay 2 (46.8\%) and Delay 1 (10.8\%). Facility assessment was the most common method of assessment (36.0\%). Only 2.7\% of studies assessed all Three Delays. We judged 62.6\% of study methodologies potentially suitable for rapid assessment. Whole health system injury research is needed as facility capacity assessments dominate. Future studies should consider novel or combined methods to study Delays 1 and 2, alongside care processes and outcomes.}},

Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users.

Background: Injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but there is a lack of consensus regarding how to evaluate injury care. Methods: Using a modification of the RAND\&sol;UCLA Appropriateness Methodology, a panel of 19 injury and quality of care experts serially rated and revised quality indicators identified from a systematic review of the literature and international audit of trauma center quality improvement practices. The quality indicators developed by the panel were sent to 133 verified trauma centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for evaluation. Results: A total of 84 quality indicators were rated and revised by the expert panel over 4 rounds of review producing 31 quality indicators of structure (n = 5), process (n = 21), and outcome (n = 5), designed to assess the safety (n = 8), effectiveness (n = 17), efficiency (n = 6), timeliness (n = 16), equity (n = 2), and patient-centeredness (n = 1) of injury care spanning prehospital (n = 8), hospital (n = 19), and posthospital (n = 2) care and secondary injury prevention (n = 1). A total of 101 trauma centers (76\&percnt; response rate) rated the indicators (1 = strong disagreement, 9 = strong agreement) as targeting important health improvements (median score 9, interquartile range \&lsqb;IQR\&rsqb; 8–9), easy to interpret (median score 8, IQR 8–9), easy to implement (median score 8, IQR 7–8), and globally good indicators (median score 8, IQR 8–9).

This review investigated the effect of these changes on global all-cause and cause-specific mortality in polytrauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, changes in trauma mechanism over time and differences between continents were analyzed. A systematic review of literature on all-cause mortality in polytrauma patients admitted to ICU was conducted. All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates were extracted as well as trauma mechanism of each patient. Poisson regression analysis was used to model time trends in all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Thirty studies, which reported mortality rates for 82,272 patients, were included and showed a decrease of 1.8\% (95\% CI 1.6–2.0\%) in all-cause mortality per year since 1966. The relative contribution of brain injury-related death has increased over the years, whereas the relative contribution of death due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis decreased. MODS was the most common cause of death in North America, and brain-related death was the most common in Asia, South America, and Europe. Penetrating trauma was most often reported in North America and Asia. All-cause mortality in polytrauma patients admitted to the ICU has decreased over the last decades. A shift from MODS to brain-related death was observed. Geographical differences in cause-specific mortality were present, which may provide region-specific learning possibilities resulting in improvement of global trauma care.}},

Identification of patients at risk of early mortality is crucial to guide clinical management and explain prognosis. Prediction models can support clinical judgement, but existing models have methodological limitations. The aim of this study was to derive a vital sign based prediction model for early mortality among adult trauma patients admitted to three public university hospitals in urban India. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult trauma patients admitted to three urban university hospitals in India between October 2013 and January 2014. The outcome measure was mortality within 24 hours. We used logistic regression with restricted cubic splines to derive our model. We assessed model performance in terms of discrimination, calibration, and optimism. Results A total of 1629 patients were included. Median age was 35, 80\% were males. Mortality between admission and 24 hours was 6\%. Our final model included systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Glasgow coma scale. Our model displayed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) of 0.85. Predicted mortality corresponded well with observed mortality, indicating good calibration. Conclusion This study showed that routinely recorded systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and Glasgow coma scale predicted early hospital mortality in trauma patients admitted to three public university hospitals in urban India. Our model needs to be externally validated before it can be applied in the clinical setting.}},

A research consortium of universities, with a mandate to reduce trauma mortality, measured the baseline 30-day in-hospital mortality rate. Between September 2013 and February 2015, trained data collectors collected on-admission demographic, physiological vital signs, and health service performance indicators (time of injury to admission, investigation, or intervention) on all patients with traumatic injuries admitted to four public university hospitals in three Indian megacities. Of the 11,202 hospitalized trauma patients, 21.4 \% died within 30 days of hospitalization. The median age was 30 years for survivors and 37 years for non-survivors. The on-admission systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score was near-normal in survivors, but was significantly lower in non-survivors and associated with both early and late mortality (p = 0.001). In the absence of a trauma system, there were process-of-care delays from injury to reaching and being examined, investigated, or operated in the hospital. Using a multi-institutional Indian registry, this study is the first to systematically document that the 30-day in-hospital trauma mortality was twice that found in similar registries from high-income countries. Physiological scoring of on-admission vitals was clinically useful to predict mortality. More research is needed to understand the causes of high mortality and time delays in the process of delivering trauma care in India, which has no prehospital or trauma system.}},

Participants included health systems researchers, philosophers, lawyers, bioethicists and institutional review board members from Botswana, Uganda, the UK, USA and Zambia. Based on discussions from the workshop, the paper affirms that, while HSR in LMICs raises ethical issues in relation to constructs (i.e. consent, risk, equipoise) common to international clinical research, the nature of the issues that arise often differ between the two fields. Three salient features of HSR and the ethical considerations associated with each of them in LMICs are described to demonstrate this point. Recommendations for institutional review boards’ oversight of HSR in LMICs are presented.

abstract = {{ Background With the rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), it is desirable to harvest information and knowledge from EHRs to support automated systems at the point of care and to enable secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. One critical component used to facilitate the secondary use of EHR data is the information extraction (IE) task, which automatically extracts and encodes clinical information from text. Objectives In this literature review, we present a review of recent published research on clinical information extraction (IE) applications. Methods A literature search was conducted for articles published from January 2009 to September 2016 based on Ovid MEDLINE In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and ACM Digital Library. Results A total of 1917 publications were identified for title and abstract screening. Of these publications, 263 articles were selected and discussed in this review in terms of publication venues and data sources, clinical IE tools, methods, and applications in the areas of disease- and drug-related studies, and clinical workflow optimizations. Conclusions Clinical IE has been used for a wide range of applications, however, there is a considerable gap between clinical studies using EHR data and studies using clinical IE. This study enabled us to gain a more concrete understanding of the gap and to provide potential solutions to bridge this gap.}},

abstract = {{ Background : Most deaths from injury occur in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) with one third potentially avoidable with better health system access. This study aimed to establish consensus on the most important barriers, within a Three Delays framework, to accessing injury care in LMICs that should be considered when evaluating a health system. Methods : A three round electronic Delphi study was conducted with experts in LMIC health systems or injury care. In round one, participants proposed important barriers. These were synthesized into a three delays framework. In round 2 participants scored four components for each barrier. Components measured whether barriers were feasible to assess, likely to delay care for a significant proportion of injured persons, likely to cause avoidable death or disability, and potentially readily changed to improve care. In round 3 participants re-scored each barrier following review of feedback from round 2. Consensus was defined for each component as ≥70\% agreement or disagreement. Results : There were 37 eligible responses in round 1, 30 in round 2, and 27 in round 3, with 21 countries represented in all rounds. Of the twenty conceptual barriers identified, consensus was reached on all four components for 11 barriers. This included 2 barriers to seeking care, 5 barriers to reaching care and 4 barriers to receiving care. The ability to modify a barrier most frequently failed to achieve consensus. Conclusion : 11 barriers were agreed to be feasible to assess, delay care for many, cause avoidable death or disability, and be readily modifiable. We recommend these barriers are considered in assessments of LMIC trauma systems.}},

abstract = {{Predicting the probability of the occurrence of a binary outcome or condition is important in biomedical research. While assessing discrimination is an essential issue in developing and validating binary prediction models, less attention has been paid to methods for assessing model calibration. Calibration refers to the degree of agreement between observed and predicted probabilities and is often assessed by testing for lack-of-fit. The objective of our study was to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess the calibration of logistic regression models. We examined lack of internal calibration, which was related to misspecification of the logistic regression model, and external calibration, which was related to an overfit model or to shrinkage of the linear predictor. We conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations with a locally weighted least squares regression smoother (i.e., the loess algorithm) to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess model calibration. We found that loess-based methods were able to provide evidence of moderate departures from linearity and indicate omission of a moderately strong interaction. Misspecification of the link function was harder to detect. Visual patterns were clearer with higher sample sizes, higher incidence of the outcome, or higher discrimination. Loess-based methods were also able to identify the lack of calibration in external validation samples when an overfit regression model had been used. In conclusion, loess-based smoothing methods are adequate tools to graphically assess calibration and merit wider application.}},

Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.}},

In the present simulation study using artificial data of known structure, the impact of the difficulty of the segmentation task on the required sample size is analyzed in dependence of the number of variables in the segmentation base. Under all simulated data circumstances, a sample size of 70 times the number of variables proves to be adequate.

This study aimed 1) to describe reporting of the Delphi method to develop quality indicators, 2) to discuss specific methodological skills for quality indicators selection 3) to give guidance about this practice.

METHODOLOGY AND MAIN FINDING:Three electronic data bases were searched over a 30 years period (1978-2009). All articles that used the Delphi method to select quality indicators were identified. A standardized data extraction form was developed. Four domains (questionnaire preparation, expert panel, progress of the survey and Delphi results) were assessed. Of 80 included studies, quality of reporting varied significantly between items (9\% for year's number of experience of the experts to 98\% for the type of Delphi used). Reporting of methodological aspects needed to evaluate the reliability of the survey was insufficient: only 39\% (31/80) of studies reported response rates for all rounds, 60\% (48/80) that feedback was given between rounds, 77\% (62/80) the method used to achieve consensus and 57\% (48/80) listed quality indicators selected at the end of the survey. A modified Delphi procedure was used in 49/78 (63\%) with a physical meeting of the panel members, usually between Delphi rounds. Median number of panel members was 17(Q1:11; Q3:31). In 40/70 (57\%) studies, the panel included multiple stakeholders, who were healthcare professionals in 95\% (38/40) of cases. Among 75 studies describing criteria to select quality indicators, 28 (37\%) used validity and 17(23\%) feasibility.

CONCLUSION:The use and reporting of the Delphi method for quality indicators selection need to be improved. We provide some guidance to the investigators to improve the using and reporting of the method in future surveys.}},

doi = {10.1016/s0140-6736(18)32203-7},
abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017.

METHODS:The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries-Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised.

FINDINGS:At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73·4\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 72·5-74·1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18·6\% (17·9-19·6), and injuries 8·0\% (7·7-8·2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22·7\% (21·5-23·9), representing an additional 7·61 million (7·20-8·01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7·9\% (7·0-8·8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22·2\% (20·0-24·0) and the death rate by 31·8\% (30·1-33·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2·3\% (0·5-4·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13·7\% (12·2-15·1) to 57·9 deaths (55·9-59·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000-289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000-363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118·0\% (88·8-148·6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36·4\% (32·2-40·6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33·6\% (31·2-36·1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990-neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases-were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases.

INTERPRETATION:Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

Previous research has shown that when severely injured patients are managed in an organized system of care that includes treatment by paramedics, transportation to a hospital that has specialist doctors available to treat their injuries, and additional health personnel to help them to rehabilitate, patients are more likely to survive and suffer fewer disabilities. There are a number of ways that the quality of care provided to injured patients in a trauma system can be determined and improved. Trauma audit filters are descriptions of specific actions that should be taken, timeframes in which tests or treatments should be provided, or outcomes that are expected to occur in injured patients. Reviewing the charts of patients whose care deviates from that described by an audit filter and providing feedback to the clinicians involved in that patient's care is expected to provide a means of correcting errors and improving future performance. Our study tried to determine how effective audit filters are at improving trauma care. We were unable to find any studies to include in the review. More studies are needed to determine if audit filters are effective in improving care and, if they are, how effective they are in comparison to other quality improvement strategies.}},

abstract = {{A systematic analysis of trauma deaths is a step towards trauma quality improvement in Indian hospitals. This study estimates the magnitude of preventable trauma deaths in five Indian hospitals, and uses a peer-review process to identify opportunities for improvement (OFI) in trauma care delivery. All trauma deaths that occurred within 30\&nbsp;days of hospitalization in five urban university hospitals in India were retrospectively abstracted for demography, mechanism of injury, transfer status, injury description by clinical, investigation and operative findings. Using mixed methods, they were quantitatively stratified by the standardized Injury Severity Score (ISS) into mild (1–8), moderate (9–15), severe (16–25), profound (26–75) ISS categories, and by time to death within 24\&nbsp;h, 7, or 30\&nbsp;days. Using peer-review and Delphi methods, we defined optimal trauma care within the Indian context and evaluated each death for preventability, using the following categories: Preventable (P), Potentially preventable (PP), Non-preventable (NP) and Non-preventable but care could have been improved (NPI). During the 18\&nbsp;month study period, there were 11,671 trauma admissions and 2523 deaths within 30\&nbsp;days (21.6\%). The overall proportion of preventable deaths was 58\%, among 2057 eligible deaths. In patients with a mild ISS score, 71\% of deaths were preventable. In the moderate category, 56\% were preventable, and 60\% in the severe group and 44\% in the profound group were preventable. Traumatic brain injury and burns accounted for the majority of non-preventable deaths. The important areas for improvement in the preventable deaths subset, inadequacies in airway management (14.3\%) and resuscitation with hemorrhage control (16.3\%). System-related issues included lack of protocols, lack of adherence to protocols, pre-hospital delays and delays in imaging. Fifty-eight percent of all trauma deaths were classified as preventable. Two-thirds of the deaths with injury severity scores of less than 16 were preventable. This large subgroup of Indian urban trauma patients could possibly be saved by urgent attention and corrective action. Low-cost interventions such as airway management, fluid resuscitation, hemorrhage control and surgical decision-making protocols, were identified as OFI. Establishment of clinical protocols and timely processes of trauma care delivery are the next steps towards improving care.}},

abstract = {{IntroductionProspective clinical audit of trauma care improves outcomes for the injured in high-income countries (HICs). However, equivalent, context-appropriate audit filters for use in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) district-level hospitals have not been well established. We aimed to develop context-appropriate trauma care audit filters for district-level hospitals in Ghana, was well as other LMICs more broadly.MethodsConsensus on trauma care audit filters was built between twenty panellists using a Delphi technique with four anonymous, iterative surveys designed to elicit: (i) trauma care processes to be measured; (ii) important features of audit filters for the district-level hospital setting; and (iii) potentially useful filters. Filters were ranked on a scale from 0 to 10 (10 being very useful). Consensus was measured with average percent majority opinion (APMO) cut-off rate. Target consensus was defined a priori as: a median rank of ≥9 for each filter and an APMO cut-off rate of ≥0.8.ResultsPanellists agreed on trauma care processes to target (e.g. triage, phases of trauma assessment, early referral if needed) and specific features of filters for district-level hospital use (e.g. simplicity, unassuming of resource capacity). APMO cut-off rate increased successively: Round 1 – 0.58; Round 2 – 0.66; Round 3 – 0.76; and Round 4 – 0.82. After Round 4, target consensus on 22 trauma care and referral-specific filters was reached. Example filters include: triage – vital signs are recorded within 15min of arrival (must include breathing assessment, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation if available); circulation – a large bore IV was placed within 15min of patient arrival; referral – if referral is activated, the referring clinician and receiving facility communicate by phone or radio prior to transfer.ConclusionThis study proposes trauma care audit filters appropriate for LMIC district-level hospitals. Given the successes of similar filters in HICs and obstetric care filters in LMICs, the collection and reporting of prospective trauma care audit filters may be an important step towards improving care for the injured at district-level hospitals in LMICs.}},

doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2018.07.048},
abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Injuries are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Developing countries account for 90\% of injury-related deaths globally. Trauma audit filters can facilitate trauma quality improvement initiatives and reduce the injury burden. Little is known about context-appropriate trauma audit filters for developing countries such as Cameroon. This study aimed to (1) develop context-appropriate trauma audit filters for the setting of a regional referral hospital in Cameroon and (2) to assess the barriers and facilitators to their implementation.

METHODS:Feasible audit filters were identified by a panel of Cameroonian surgeons using the Delphi technique. A Likert scale (1 to 5, with 5 as "Most Useful") was used to rank the filters for utility in a regional referral hospital setting, analyzed using the median and interquartile range. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 health care providers from three hospital facilities to explore their perceptions of supervision and support they receive from hospital administration, availability of resources, their work environment, and potential concerns and impacts of trauma audit filters. Interviews were coded and thematically analyzed.

RESULTS:Within a panel of seven surgeons, 23 of 40 trauma audit filter variables met majority consensus criteria. Twenty-one of these, comprising mostly of primary survey and basic resuscitation techniques, had a median score of ≥4. Filters meeting consensus include, but are not limited to, vitals obtained, breathing assessment made, and two large bore intravenous established within 15 min of arrival; patient with open fracture receives intravenous antimicrobials within 1 h of arrival; patients with suspected spine injury are immobilized and given X-ray. The provider interviews revealed that the barriers to providing quality care were limited human and material resources and patients' inability to pay. Regular staff training in trauma care and the belief that trauma audit filters would potentially streamline work practices and improve the quality of care were cited as promoters of successful implementation.

CONCLUSIONS:Primary survey and basic resuscitative techniques are key elements of context-appropriate audit filters in Cameroon. Such audit filters may not be costly, require complex infrastructure, or equipment that exceed the site's capabilities. Proper staff orientation and participation in the use of trauma audit filters, as quality improvement tools, are key to local buy-in and implementation success.}},

This article discusses the use of QIs in the care of trauma patients. A series of QIs were originally promulgated by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) and have been investigated for their utility in measuring quality in trauma systems by a number of US based studies. While some have advocated the implementation of several specific indicators, others have recommended discontinued use of a range of proposed QIs. This review highlights the difficulties of meeting these ideal indicator requirements in trauma care and proposes that the development of alternative indicators may provide more useful measures of quality care.}},

The concept of trauma audit filters to identify specific cases was based on the use of ideal criteria against which actual performance could be measured. The chapter also investigates institutional trauma registries which have been used to provide an ongoing database of all or various subsets of trauma patients. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) provides the scientific basis for guidelines from which institution specific pathways, protocols, or care plans can be developed.

abstract = {{Injury is a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and often disproportionately affects younger, more productive members of society. While many have made the case for improved injury prevention and trauma care, health system development in low- and middle-income countries is often limited by resources. This study aims to determine the economic benefit of improved injury prevention and trauma care in low- and middle-income countries. This study uses existing data on injury mortality worldwide from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate the number of lives that could be saved if injury mortality rates in low- and middle-income countries could be reduced to rates in high-income countries. Using economic modeling – through the human capital approach and the value of a statistical life approach – the study then demonstrates the associated economic benefit of these lives saved. 88 percent of injury-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. If injury mortality rates in low- and middle-income countries were reduced to rates in high-income countries, 2,117,500 lives could be saved per year. This would result in between 49 million and 52 million disability adjusted life years averted per year, with discounting and age weighting. Using the human capital approach, the associated economic benefit of reducing mortality rates ranges from \$245 to \$261 billion with discounting and age weighting. Using the value of a statistical life approach, the benefit is between 758 and 786 billion dollars per year. Reducing injury mortality in low- and middle-income countries could save over 2 million lives per year and provide significant economic benefit globally. Further investments in trauma care and injury prevention are needed.}},

A research consortium of universities, with a mandate to reduce trauma mortality, measured the baseline 30-day in-hospital mortality rate. Between September 2013 and February 2015, trained data collectors collected on-admission demographic, physiological vital signs, and health service performance indicators (time of injury to admission, investigation, or intervention) on all patients with traumatic injuries admitted to four public university hospitals in three Indian megacities. Of the 11,202 hospitalized trauma patients, 21.4 \% died within 30 days of hospitalization. The median age was 30 years for survivors and 37 years for non-survivors. The on-admission systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score was near-normal in survivors, but was significantly lower in non-survivors and associated with both early and late mortality (p = 0.001). In the absence of a trauma system, there were process-of-care delays from injury to reaching and being examined, investigated, or operated in the hospital. Using a multi-institutional Indian registry, this study is the first to systematically document that the 30-day in-hospital trauma mortality was twice that found in similar registries from high-income countries. Physiological scoring of on-admission vitals was clinically useful to predict mortality. More research is needed to understand the causes of high mortality and time delays in the process of delivering trauma care in India, which has no prehospital or trauma system.}},

The survey assessed the presence or absence of the four core elements of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended TQIPs (morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences, preventable death panels, trauma registries, and audit filters), and provider perception of barriers and priorities in TQIP implementation.ResultsResponses were received from 80 (72%) respondents. Seventy-two (90%) reported having a trauma registry and seventy (88%) respondents reported use of audit filters. Seventy (88%) respondents reported conducting regular M&M conferences, and 45 (56%) respondents reported the presence of preventable death panels. Thirty-eight (48%) respondents reported presence of all four elements of WHO TQIPs. The most commonly reported barriers to implementing TQIPs were lack of interest (55; 68%) and lack of time (39; 48%)to implement TQIPs.

These are high priorities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 2,000,000 deaths due to survivable injuries occur each year. We sought to define areas for improvement in trauma QI programs in four LMICs. Methods We conducted a survey among trauma care providers in four Andean middle-income countries: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Results 336 physicians, medical students, nurses, administrators and paramedical professionals responded to the cross-sectional survey with a response rate greater than 90% in all included countries except Bolivia, where the response rate was 14%. Eighty-seven percent of respondents reported morbidity and mortality (M&M) conferences occur at their hospital. Conferences were often reported as infrequent – 45% occurred less than every three months and poorly attended – 63% had five or fewer staff physicians present. Only 23% of conferences had standardized selection criteria, most lacked documentation – notes were taken at only 35% of conferences. Importantly, only 13% of participants indicated that discussions were routinely followed-up with any sort of corrective action. Multivariable analysis revealed the presence of standardized case selection criteria (OR 3.48, 95% CI 1.16–10.46), written documentation of the M&M conferences (OR 5.73, 95% CI 1.73–19.06), and a clear plan for follow-up (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.59–14.50) to be associated with effective M&M conferences. Twenty-two percent of respondents worked at hospitals with a trauma registry. Fifty-two percent worked at institutions where autopsies were conducted, but only 32% of those reported the autopsy results to ever be used to improve hospital practice. Conclusions M&M conferences are frequently practiced in the Andean region of Latin America but often lack methodologic rigor and thus effectiveness. Next steps in the maturation of QI programs include optimizing use of data from autopsies and registries, and systematic follow-up of M&M conferences with corrective action to ensure that these activities result in appreciable changes in clinical care.}, number={9}, journal={Injury}, author={LaGrone, Lacey N. and Pozo, Diego A.

During the study period from 15 March through 15 June 1982, 591 consecutive major trauma victims (MTV) were collected by the 30 participating hospitals. All medical records, including autopsy reports, were audited for the timeliness and appropriateness of diagnosis and definitive care. Deaths were classified as being not preventable, potentially salvageable, or preventable. A trauma system subsequently became functional on 1 August 1984, with five adult centers and one pediatric center. A Medical Audit Committee composed of physicians and nurses from designated and nondesignated hospitals was organized to perform a monthly concurrent audit of trauma care. Between 1 August and 31 December 1984, 1,366 MTV were triaged to trauma centers. The care of MTV was considered suboptimal in 32\% of patients before regionalization, compared to 4.2\% after regionalization (p<0.01). Preventable deaths occurred in 13.6\% of fatalities occurring before implementation of a trauma system, compared to 2.7\% after implementation (p<0.01). Regionalization of trauma care significantly reduced delays, inadequate care, and preventable deaths due to trauma. }},

The method is widely accepted in healthcare improvement; however there is little overarching evaluation of how the method is applied. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for assessing the quality of application of PDSA cycles and explores the consistency with which the method has been applied in peer-reviewed literature against this framework. NHS Evidence and Cochrane databases were searched by three independent reviewers. Empirical studies were included that reported application of the PDSA method in healthcare. Application of PDSA cycles was assessed against key features of the method, including documentation characteristics, use of iterative cycles, prediction-based testing of change, initial small-scale testing and use of data over time. 73 of 409 individual articles identified met the inclusion criteria. Of the 73 articles, 47 documented PDSA cycles in sufficient detail for full analysis against the whole framework. Many of these studies reported application of the PDSA method that failed to accord with primary features of the method. Less than 20% (14/73) fully documented the application of a sequence of iterative cycles. Furthermore, a lack of adherence to the notion of small-scale change is apparent and only 15% (7/47) reported the use of quantitative data at monthly or more frequent data intervals to inform progression of cycles. To progress the development of the science of improvement, a greater understanding of the use of improvement methods, including PDSA, is essential to draw reliable conclusions about their effectiveness. This would be supported by the development of systematic and rigorous standards for the application and reporting of PDSAs.}, number={4}, journal={BMJ Quality & Safety}, author={Taylor, Michael J and McNicholas, Chris and Nicolay, Chris and Darzi, Ara and Bell, Derek and Reed, Julie E}, year={2014}, pages={290} }

Methods: The business and health care literature was systematically reviewed to identify contextual factors that might influence QI success; to categorize, summarize, and synthesize these factors; and to understand the current stage of development of this research field. Findings: Forty-seven articles were included in the final review. Consistent with current theories of implementation and organization change, leadership from top management, organizational culture, data infrastructure and information systems, and years involved in QI were suggested as important to QI success. Other potentially important factors identified in this review included: physician involvement in QI, microsystem motivation to change, resources for QI, and QI team leadership. Key limitations in the existing literature were the lack of a practical conceptual model, the lack of clear definitions of contextual factors, and the lack of well-specified measures. Conclusions: Several contextual factors were shown to be important to QI success, although the current body of literature lacks adequate definitions and is characterized by considerable variability in how contextual factors are measured across studies. Future research should focus on identifying and developing measures of context tied to a conceptual model that examines context across all levels of the health care system and explores the relationships among various aspects of context.}, number={4}, journal={The Milbank Quarterly}, author={KAPLAN, HEATHER C. and BRADY, PATRICK W. and DRITZ, MICHELE C. and HOOPER, DAVID K. and LINAM, W.

Health services researchers recognize the need to evaluate not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes to assess the extent to which implementation is effective in a specific setting, prolongs sustainability, and promotes dissemination into other settings. Many implementation theories have been published to help promote effective implementation. However, they overlap considerably in the constructs included in individual theories, and a comparison of theories reveals that each is missing important constructs included in other theories. In addition, terminology and definitions are not consistent across theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework For Implementation Research (CFIR) that offers an overarching typology to promote implementation theory development and verification about what works where and why across multiple contexts. We used a snowball sampling approach to identify published theories that were evaluated to identify constructs based on strength of conceptual or empirical support for influence on implementation, consistency in definitions, alignment with our own findings, and potential for measurement. We combined constructs across published theories that had different labels but were redundant or overlapping in definition, and we parsed apart constructs that conflated underlying concepts. The CFIR is composed of five major domains: intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of the individuals involved, and the process of implementation. Eight constructs were identified related to the intervention (e.g., evidence strength and quality), four constructs were identified related to outer setting (e.g., patient needs and resources), 12 constructs were identified related to inner setting (e.g., culture, leadership engagement), five constructs were identified related to individual characteristics, and eight constructs were identified related to process (e.g., plan, evaluate, and reflect). We present explicit definitions for each construct. The CFIR provides a pragmatic structure for approaching complex, interacting, multi-level, and transient states of constructs in the real world by embracing, consolidating, and unifying key constructs from published implementation theories. It can be used to guide formative evaluations and build the implementation knowledge base across multiple studies and settings.}, number={1}, journal={Implementation Science}, author={Damschroder, Laura J and Aron, David C and Keith, Rosalind E and Kirsh, Susan R and Alexander, Jeffery A and Lowery, Julie C}, year={2009}, pages={50} }

Action to effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable and comprehensive state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available so far for all major diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016. Methods Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative estimated burden (metrics were deaths, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions and injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India into four epidemiological transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined in 2016. We assessed variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups and between states to inform a more specific health-system response in the states and for India as a whole. Findings DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 for India, but this transition had a range of 24 years for the four ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36·2% in India from 1990 to 2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs between 1990 and 2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, numbers of DALYs increased substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for injuries in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, and a modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass index, increased from 1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence rate of the leading causes of injuries also increased from 1990 to 2016. The five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease; and the five leading risk factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. Behind these broad trends many variations existed between the ETL state groups and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes of disease burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for individual causes. Interpretation Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by about a third in India over the past 26 years. However, the magnitude and causes of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter century apart in the four ETL state groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest ETL states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its causes across the states of India can be a crucial input for more specific health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India’s premier think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the National Health Policy 2017.

Large health disparities between states, between rural and urban populations, and across social classes persist. A large proportion of the population is impoverished because of high out-of-pocket health-care expenditures and suffers the adverse consequences of poor quality of care. Here we make the case not only for more resources but for a radically new architecture for India’s health-care system. India needs to adopt an integrated national health-care system built around a strong public primary care system with a clearly articulated supportive role for the private and indigenous sectors. This system must address acute as well as chronic health-care needs, offer choice of care that is rational, accessible, and of good quality, support cashless service at point of delivery, and ensure accountability through governance by a robust regulatory framework. In the process, several major challenges will need to be confronted, most notably the very low levels of public expenditure; the poor regulation, rapid commercialisation of and corruption in health care; and the fragmentation of governance of health care. Most importantly, assuring universal health coverage will require the explicit acknowledgment, by government and civil society, of health care as a public good on par with education. Only a radical restructuring of the health-care system that promotes health equity and eliminates impoverishment due to out-of-pocket expenditures will assure health for all Indians by 2022—a fitting way to mark the 75th year of India’s independence.}, number={10011}, journal={The Lancet}, author={Patel, Vikram and Parikh, Rachana and Nandraj, Sunil and Balasubramaniam, Priya and Narayan, Kavita and Paul, Vinod K and Kumar, A K Shiva and Chatterjee, Mirai and Reddy, K Srinath}, year={2015}, pages={2422–2435} }

It is common to extend the use of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) audit filters to this scope. This mandates that their actual link with outcome be demonstrated. Several studies attempted to do so, but with inconsistent risk-adjustment, conflicting results and never using long-term disability as outcome measure, despite its recognised importance. We tried to overcome these limitations.MethodsRisk-adjusted analysis of the association of filters 1, 3, 10 and 13 with 30-day mortality and 6-month disability measured with the EQ5D scale. Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were used respectively. The data came from a National Italian Trauma Registry comprising 838 patients with major trauma.ResultsThree (1, 3 and 10) of the filters analysed did not show any significant association with either outcome. Filter 13 was associated with decreased mortality and lower (worse) disability scores.ConclusionsMethodological difficulties, incomplete, obsolete or non-generalisable definitions of some filters can explain the generally poor correlation with outcomes. The conflicting association of filter 13 with the two types of outcomes raises some interesting questions about the targeted outcomes in trauma research.It is recommended that further studies develop better quality indicators and test their link with both survival and functional outcome in the same setting where they are applied for assessment and comparison of trauma care.}, number={9}, journal={Injury}, author={Bartolomeo, Stefano Di and Valent, Francesca and Sanson, Gianfranco and Nardi, Giuseppe and Gambale, Giorgio and Barbone, Fabio}, year={2008}, pages={1001–1006} }

They sparked off a prolonged acrimonious and public debate and deeply divided the scientific community. They also provided an impetus for the revision of the Declaration of Helsinki – the most widely known guideline for international research. In this paper, I provide a brief summary of the context, outline the arguments for and against the controversial use of placebo controls, and focus on particular areas that I believe merit further discussion or clarification. On balance, I argue that the researchers failed in their duties to protect the best interests of their research subjects, and to promote distributive justice. I discuss the difficulties of obtaining valid consent in this research context, and argue that it is unethical to inform women of their HIV status without at least offering them prophylactic treatment for their unborn children. A global view of justice, which endorses international equity, cannot be squared with international research guidelines that allow ‘local conditions’ to define the scope of duty to the control group. Finally, I suggest that the heated debate reflects a tension, if not an outright war, between two conflicting meta-ethical systems, or incommensurable paradigms, that underpin scientific research involving human subjects.}, number={4}, journal={Bioethics}, author={Zulueta, Paquita De}, year={2001}, pages={289–311} }

abstract = {Background: Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. Methods: The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countries—Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised. Findings: At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 72{\textperiodcentered}5–74{\textperiodcentered}1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (17{\textperiodcentered}9–19{\textperiodcentered}6), and injuries 8{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}7–8{\textperiodcentered}2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}5–23{\textperiodcentered}9), representing an additional 7{\textperiodcentered}61 million (7{\textperiodcentered}20–8{\textperiodcentered}01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}0–8{\textperiodcentered}8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (20{\textperiodcentered}0–24{\textperiodcentered}0) and the death rate by 31{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (30{\textperiodcentered}1–33{\textperiodcentered}3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}5–4{\textperiodcentered}0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}2–15{\textperiodcentered}1) to 57{\textperiodcentered}9 deaths (55{\textperiodcentered}9–59{\textperiodcentered}2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000–289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000–363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (88{\textperiodcentered}8–148{\textperiodcentered}6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (32{\textperiodcentered}2–40{\textperiodcentered}6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (31{\textperiodcentered}2–36{\textperiodcentered}1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990—neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases—were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. Interpretation: Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

Patients from 1998 onward were entered in to this registry, enabling a preimplementation and postimplementation study. Adults ({\textgreater}15 years) with blunt or penetrating trauma were analyzed. The main outcomes of interest were (1) in-hospital mortality and (2) occurrence of any complication.

abstract = {Introduction Prospective clinical audit of trauma care improves outcomes for the injured in high-income countries (HICs). However, equivalent, context-appropriate audit filters for use in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) district-level hospitals have not been well established. We aimed to develop context-appropriate trauma care audit filters for district-level hospitals in Ghana, was well as other LMICs more broadly. Methods Consensus on trauma care audit filters was built between twenty panellists using a Delphi technique with four anonymous, iterative surveys designed to elicit: (i) trauma care processes to be measured; (ii) important features of audit filters for the district-level hospital setting; and (iii) potentially useful filters. Filters were ranked on a scale from 0 to 10 (10 being very useful). Consensus was measured with average percent majority opinion (APMO) cut-off rate. Target consensus was defined a priori as: a median rank of ???9 for each filter and an APMO cut-off rate of ???0.8. Results Panellists agreed on trauma care processes to target (e.g. triage, phases of trauma assessment, early referral if needed) and specific features of filters for district-level hospital use (e.g. simplicity, unassuming of resource capacity). APMO cut-off rate increased successively: Round 1 - 0.58; Round 2 - 0.66; Round 3 - 0.76; and Round 4 - 0.82. After Round 4, target consensus on 22 trauma care and referral-specific filters was reached. Example filters include: triage - vital signs are recorded within 15 min of arrival (must include breathing assessment, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation if available); circulation - a large bore IV was placed within 15 min of patient arrival; referral - if referral is activated, the referring clinician and receiving facility communicate by phone or radio prior to transfer. Conclusion This study proposes trauma care audit filters appropriate for LMIC district-level hospitals. Given the successes of similar filters in HICs and obstetric care filters in LMICs, the collection and reporting of prospective trauma care audit filters may be an important step towards improving care for the injured at district-level hospitals in LMICs.},

abstract = {For use in quality measurement, a quality indicator (QI) must satisfy a number of criteria: there needs to be an established link with outcome; the indicator needs to measure what is considered current accepted practice; the targeted population requires precise definition; an appropriate risk adjustment strategy must be employed; the indicator should be feasible for collection; and, the measure must apply to a sufficient number of people so as to provide a measure of system-wide quality. This article discusses the use of QIs in the care of trauma patients. A series of QIs were originally promulgated by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCOT) and have been investigated for their utility in measuring quality in trauma systems by a number of US based studies. While some have advocated the implementation of several specific indicators, others have recommended discontinued use of a range of proposed QIs. This review highlights the difficulties of meeting these ideal indicator requirements in trauma care and proposes that the development of alternative indicators may provide more useful measures of quality care. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Introduction Quality improvement programmes are an important part of care delivery in trauma centres. The objective was to describe the effect of a comprehensive quality improvement programme on long term patient outcome trends at a low volume major trauma centre in Australia. Methods All patients aged 15 years and over with major trauma (Injury Severity Score {\textgreater} 15) admitted to a single inner city major trauma centre between 1992 and 2012 were studied. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and transfer to rehabilitation. Time series analysis using integer valued autoregressive Poisson models was used to determine the reduction in adjusted monthly count data associated with the intervention period (2007-2012). Risk adjusted odds ratios for mortality over three yearly intervals was also obtained using multivariable logistic regression. Crude and risk adjusted mortality was compared before and after the implementation period. Results 3856 patients were analysed. Crude in-hospital mortality fell from 16{\%} to 10{\%} after implementation (p {\textless} 0.001). The intervention period was associated with a 25{\%} decrease in monthly mortality counts. Risk adjusted mortality remained stable from 1992 to 2006 and did not fall until the intervention period. Crude and risk adjusted transfer to in-patient rehabilitation after major trauma also declined during the intervention period. Conclusion In this low volume major trauma centre, the implementation of a comprehensive quality improvement programme was associated with a reduction in crude and risk adjusted mortality and risk adjusted discharge to rehabilitation in severely injured patients. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This article shows how to apply generalized additive models and generalized additive mixed models to single-case design data. These models excel at detecting the functional form between two variables (often called trend), that is, whether trend exists, and if it does, what its shape is (e.g., linear and nonlinear). In many respects, however, these models are also an ideal vehicle for analyzing single-case designs because they can consider level, trend, variability, overlap, immediacy of effect, and phase consistency that single-case design researchers examine when interpreting a functional relation. We show how these models can be implemented in a wide variety of ways to test whether treatment is effective, whether cases differ from each other, whether treatment effects vary over cases, and whether trend varies over cases. We illustrate diagnostic statistics and graphs, and we discuss overdispersion of data in detail, with examples of quasibinomial models for overdispersed data, including how to compute dispersion and quasi-AIC fit indices in generalized additive models. We show how generalized additive mixed models can be used to estimate autoregressive models and random effects and discuss the limitations of the mixed models compared to generalized additive models. We provide extensive annotated syntax for doing all these analyses in the free computer program R. ?? 2013 Society for the Study of School Psychology.},

@article{Evans2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries represent a considerable public health burden with significant personal and societal costs. The care of the severely injured patient in a trauma system progresses along a continuum that includes numerous interventions being provided by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare personnel. Despite the recent emphasis on quality of care in medicine, there has been little research to direct trauma clinicians and administrators on how optimally to monitor and improve upon the quality of care delivered within a trauma system. Audit filters are one mechanism for improving quality of care and are defined as specific clinical processes or outcomes of care that, when they occur, represent unfavorable deviations from an established norm and which prompt review and feedback. Although audit filters are widely utilized for performance improvement in trauma systems they have not been subjected to systematic review of their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of using audit filters for improving processes of care and clinical outcomes in trauma systems. SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search strategy included an electronic search of the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane EPOC Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science: (SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S). We handsearched the Journal of Trauma, Injury, Annals of Emergency Medicine, Academic Emergency Medicine, and Injury Prevention. We searched two clinical trial registries: 1) The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and, 2) Clinical Trials.gov. We also contacted content experts for further articles. The most recent electronic search was completed in December 2008 and the handsearch was completed up to February 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series studies that used audit filters as an intervention for improving processes of care, morbidity, or mortality for severely injured patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the search results, applied inclusion criteria, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: There were no studies identified that met the inclusion criteria for this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any studies of sufficient methodological quality to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of audit filters as a performance improvement intervention in trauma systems. Future research using rigorous study designs should focus on the relative effectiveness of audit filters in comparison to alternative quality improvement strategies at improving processes of care, functional outcomes, and mortality for injured patients.},

This paper utilizes the year 2004 World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease Study estimates to illustrate the global and regional burden of unintentional injuries and injury rates, stratified by cause, region, age, and gender. The worldwide rate of unintentional injuries is 61 per 100,000 population per year. Overall, road traffic injuries make up the largest proportion of unintentional injury deaths (33{\%}). When standardized per 100,000 population, the death rate is nearly double in LMIC versus high-income countries (65 vs. 35 per 100,000), and the rate of disability-adjusted life-years is more than triple in LMIC (2,398 vs. 774 per 100,000). This paper calls for more action around 5 core areas that need research investments and capacity development, particularly in LMIC: 1) improving injury data collection, 2) defining the epidemiology of unintentional injuries, 3) estimating the costs of injuries, 4) understanding public perceptions about injury causation, and 5) engaging with policy makers to improve injury prevention and control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The CRASH-2 trial showed that early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) safely reduces mortality in bleeding in trauma patients. Based on data from the CRASH-2 trial, global mortality data and a systematic literature review, we estimated the number of premature deaths that might be averted every year worldwide through the use of TXA. METHODS: We used CRASH-2 trial data to examine the effect of TXA on death due to bleeding by geographical region. We used WHO mortality data (2008) and data from a systematic review of the literature to estimate the annual number of in-hospital trauma deaths due to bleeding. We then used the relative risk estimates from the CRASH-2 trial to estimate the number of premature deaths that could be averted if all hospitalised bleeding trauma patients received TXA within one hour of injury, and within three hours of injury. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the effect of uncertainty in the parameter estimates and the assumptions made in the model. RESULTS: There is no evidence that the effect of TXA on death due to bleeding varies by geographical region (heterogeneity p = 0.70). Based on WHO data and our systematic literature review, we estimate that each year worldwide there are approximately 400,000 in-hospital trauma deaths due to bleeding. If patients received TXA within one hour of injury then approximately 128,000 (uncertainty range [UR] approximately 72,000 to 172,000) deaths might be averted. If patients received TXA within three hours of injury then approximately 112,000 (UR approximately 68,000 to 148,000) deaths might be averted. Country specific estimates show that the largest numbers of deaths averted would be in India and China. CONCLUSIONS: The use of TXA in the treatment of traumatic bleeding has the potential to prevent many premature deaths every year. A large proportion of the potential health gains are in low and middle income countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality improvement (QI) programs are an integral part of well-developed trauma systems. However, they have not been extensively implemented globally. To promote greater use of effective QI programs, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC) have been collaboratively developing the upcoming Guidelines for Trauma Quality Improvement Programmes. As part of the development of this publication and to satisfy global demands for WHO guidelines to be evidence based, we conducted a thorough literature search on the effectiveness of trauma QI programs. METHODS: The review was based on a PubMed search of all articles reporting an outcome from a trauma QI program. RESULTS: Thirty-six articles were identified that reported results of evaluations of a trauma QI program or in which the trauma QI program was integrally related to identification and correction of specific problems. Thirteen of these articles reported on mortality as their main outcome; 12 reported on changes in morbidity (infection rates, complications), patient satisfaction, costs, or other outcomes of tangible patient benefit; and 11 reported on changes in process of care. Thirty articles addressed hospital-based care; four system-wide care; and two prehospital care. Thirty-four articles reported an improvement in the outcome assessed; two reported no change; and none reported worsening of the outcome. Five articles also reported cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma QI programs are consistently shown to improve the process of care, decrease mortality, and decrease costs. Further efforts to promote trauma QI globally are warranted. These findings support the further development and promulgation of the WHO-IATSIC Guidelines for Trauma QI Programmes.},

@article{Murray2012,
abstract = {Background Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time. Methods We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights. Findings Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2 503 billion) to 2010 (2 490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23{\%} (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41{\%} of global DALYs in 1990 to 25{\%} in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia); rising to over 80{\%} of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47{\%} of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43{\%} from non-communicable diseases, and 10{\%} from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35{\%}, 54{\%}, and 11{\%}, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010; (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29{\%}), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44{\%} decline in DALYs); stroke; (fifth in 1990; 19{\%} increase); diarrhoeal diseases; (second in 1990; 51{\%} decrease); and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351{\%} increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37{\%} increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34{\%} increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions. Interpretation Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results.},

              Recovery is incomplete-even up to eight months post discharge,
              participants had needs unmet by the healthcare system. Recovery
              is expensive-participants struggled with a range of direct and

              protocol for documentation, 20 assessment criteria, and the
              judgement of data by a quality circle. After implementation in
              Munich (1st period, n=90; 2nd period, n=77) the validation took
              place in Essen (1st period, n=175; 2nd period, n=150). RESULTS:
              Improvements in diagnostics were shown by significant time
              savings in radiological diagnostics and before computed
              tomography in severe traumatic brain injury. In patients with
              hemorrhagic shock there was a reduction in time before
              transfusion (49 to 14 min in Munich; 31 to 22 min in Essen) and
              before emergency operation (74 to 43 min in Munich; 69 to 45 min
              in Essen). The time before craniotomy was reduced from 97 to 67
              min in Munich. The incidence of delayed diagnosis of
              life-threatening lesions was diminished from 6\% to 3\% in Munich
              (not found in Essen). The TRISS technique showed a reduction in
              mortality in both hospitals in the second period (Munich: 15.4\%
              TRISS vs. 9.1\% observed mortality; Essen: 17.8\% vs. 11.3\%).

              definitions and clinical audit criteria, a systematic review of

              Five main obstetric complications were selected and definitions

              about the comparative effectiveness in reducing mortality of
              trauma care systems at different stages of development. The
              objective of this study was to review the literature and examine
              differences in mortality associated with different stages of
              trauma system development. METHOD: A systematic review of
              peer-reviewed population-based studies retrieved from MEDLINE,
              EMBASE, and CINAHL. Additional studies were identified from
              references of articles, through database searching, and author
              lists. Articles written in English and published between 2000 and
              2020 were included. Selection of studies, data extraction, and
              quality assessment of the included studies were performed by two
              independent reviewers. The results were reported as odds ratio
              (OR) with 95 \% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 52
              studies with a combined 1,106,431 traumatic injury patients were
              included for quantitative analysis. The overall mortality rate
              was 6.77\% (n = 74,930). When patients were treated in a
              non-trauma centre compared to a trauma centre, the pooled
              statistical odds of mortality were reduced (OR 0.74 [95\% CI
              0.69-0.79]; p < 0.001). When patients were treated in a
              non-trauma system compared to a trauma system the odds of
              mortality rates increased (OR 1.17 [95\% CI 1.10-1.24]; p <
              0.001). When patients were treated in a
              post-implementation/initial system compared to a mature system,
              odds of mortality were significantly higher (OR 1.46 [95\% CI
              1.37-1.55]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study highlights
              that the survival of traumatic injured patients varies according
              to the stage of trauma system development in which the patient
              was treated. The analysis indicates a significant reduction in
              mortality following the introduction of the trauma system which
              is further enhanced as the system matures. These results provide
              evidence to support efforts to, firstly, implement trauma systems
              in countries currently without and, secondly, to enhance existing
              systems by investing in system development. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

              programme on long term patient outcome trends at a low volume
              major trauma centre in Australia. METHODS: All patients aged 15
              years and over with major trauma (Injury Severity Score>15)
              admitted to a single inner city major trauma centre between 1992
              and 2012 were studied. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital
              mortality and transfer to rehabilitation. Time series analysis
              using integer valued autoregressive Poisson models was used to
              determine the reduction in adjusted monthly count data associated
              with the intervention period (2007-2012). Risk adjusted odds
              ratios for mortality over three yearly intervals was also
              obtained using multivariable logistic regression. Crude and risk
              adjusted mortality was compared before and after the
              implementation period. RESULTS: 3856 patients were analysed.
              Crude in-hospital mortality fell from 16\% to 10\% after
              implementation (p<0.001). The intervention period was associated
              with a 25\% decrease in monthly mortality counts. Risk adjusted
              mortality remained stable from 1992 to 2006 and did not fall
              until the intervention period. Crude and risk adjusted transfer
              to in-patient rehabilitation after major trauma also declined
              during the intervention period. CONCLUSION: In this low volume
              major trauma centre, the implementation of a comprehensive
              quality improvement programme was associated with a reduction in
              crude and risk adjusted mortality and risk adjusted discharge to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Due to complex geography and resource constraints,
              trauma patients are often initially transported to community or
              rural facilities rather than a larger Level I or II trauma
              center. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize
              evidence on interventions that improved the quality of trauma
              care and/or reduced healthcare costs at non-Level I or II
              facilities. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to identify
              studies implementing a Quality Improvement (QI) initiative at a
              non-major trauma center (i.e., non-Level I or II trauma center
              [or equivalent]). We searched 3 electronic databases (MEDLINE,
              Embase, CINAHL) and the grey literature (relevant networks,
              organizations/associations). Methodological quality was evaluated
              using NIH and JBI study quality assessment tools. Studies were
              included if they evaluated the effect of implementing a trauma
              care QI initiative on one or more of the following: 1) trauma
              outcomes (mortality, morbidity); 2) system outcomes (e.g., length
              of stay [LOS], transfer times, provider factors); 3) provider
              knowledge or perception; or 4) healthcare costs. Pediatric
              trauma, pre-hospital and tele-trauma specific studies were
              excluded. RESULTS: Of 1046 data sources screened, 36 were
              included for full review (29 journal articles, 7
              abstracts/posters without full text). Educational initiatives
              including the Rural Trauma Team Development Course and the
              Advanced Trauma Life Support course were the most common QI
              interventions investigated. Study outcomes included process
              metrics such as transfer time to tertiary care and hospital LOS,
              along with measures of provider perception and knowledge.
              Improvement in mortality was reported in a single study
              evaluating the impact of establishing a dedicated trauma service
              at a community hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our review captured a broad
              spectrum of trauma QI projects implemented at non-major trauma
              centers. Educational interventions did result in process outcome
              improvements and high rates of self-reported improvements in
              trauma care. Given the heterogeneous capabilities of community
              and rural hospitals, there is no panacea for trauma QI at these
              facilities. Future research should focus on patient outcomes like
              mortality and morbidity, and locally relevant initiatives.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Trauma is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity
              globally, disproportionately affecting low/middle-income
              countries (LMICs). Understanding the factors determining
              implementation success for in-hospital Trauma Quality Improvement
              Programs (TQIPs) is critical to reducing the global trauma
              burden. We synthesised topical literature to identify key
              facilitators and barriers to in-hospital TQIP implementation
              across country income levels. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA
              SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science and Global Index Medicus
              databases were searched from June 2009 to January 2022.
              ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Published literature involving any study
              design, written in English and evaluating any implemented
              in-hospital quality improvement programme in trauma populations
              worldwide. Literature that was non-English, unpublished and
              involved non-hospital TQIPs was excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND
              SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers completed a three-stage screening
              process using Covidence, with any discrepancies resolved through
              a third reviewer. Content analysis using the Consolidated
              Framework for Implementation Research identified facilitator and
              barrier themes for in-hospital TQIP implementation. RESULTS:
              Twenty-eight studies met the eligibility criteria from 3923
              studies identified. The most discussed in-hospital TQIPs in
              included literature were trauma registries. Facilitators and
              barriers were similar across all country income levels. The main
              facilitator themes identified were the prioritisation of staff
              education and training, strengthening stakeholder dialogue and
              providing standardised best-practice guidelines. The key barrier
              theme identified in LMICs was poor data quality, while
              high-income countries (HICs) had reduced communication across
              professional hierarchies. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholder prioritisation
              of in-hospital TQIPs, along with increased knowledge and
              consensus of trauma care best practices, are essential efforts to
              reduce the global trauma burden. The primary focus of future
              studies on in-hospital TQIPs in LMICs should target improving
              registry data quality, while interventions in HICs should target
              strengthening communication channels between healthcare
              professionals.",

              success rates of strategies to improve quality and safety in
              health care are in part due to the different contexts in which
              the interventions are planned and implemented. The objectives of
              this study were to (i) describe the reporting of contextual
              factors in the literature on the effectiveness of quality
              improvement strategies, (ii) assess the relationship between
              effectiveness and contextual factors, and (iii) analyse the
              importance of contextual factors. METHODS: We conducted an
              umbrella review of systematic reviews searching the following
              databases: PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,
              Embase and CINAHL. The search focused on quality improvement
              strategies included in the Cochrane Effective Practice and
              Organisation of Care Group taxonomy. We extracted data on quality
              improvement effectiveness and context factors. The latter were
              categorized according to the Model for Understanding Success in
              Quality tool. RESULTS: We included 56 systematic reviews in this
              study of which only 35 described contextual factors related with
              the effectiveness of quality improvement interventions. The most
              frequently reported contextual factors were: quality improvement
              team (n = 12), quality improvement support and capacity (n = 11),
              organization (n = 9), micro-system (n = 8), and external
              environment (n = 4). Overall, context factors were poorly
              reported. Where they were reported, they seem to explain
              differences in quality improvement effectiveness; however,
              publication bias may contribute to the observed differences.
              CONCLUSIONS: Contextual factors may influence the effectiveness
              of quality improvement interventions, in particular at the level
              of the clinical micro-system. Future research on the
              implementation and effectiveness of quality improvement
              interventions should emphasize formative evaluation to elicit
              information on context factors and report on them in a more

              Improvement Program (ACS TQIP) provides feedback to hospitals on
              risk-adjusted outcomes. The Michigan Trauma Quality Improvement
              Program (MTQIP) goes beyond the provision of feedback alone,
              focusing on collaborative quality improvement. It is unknown
              whether the addition of a collaborative approach to benchmark
              reporting improves outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
              association of hospital participation in the ACS TQIP (benchmark
              reporting) or the MTQIP (benchmark reporting and collaborative
              quality improvement) with outcomes compared with control
              hospitals that did not participate in either program. DESIGN,
              SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, data from the
              National Trauma Data Bank from 2009 to 2015 were used. A total of
              2 373 130 trauma patients 16 years or older with an Injury
              Severity Score of 5 or more were identified from 98 ACS TQIP
              hospitals, 23 MTQIP hospitals, and 429 nonparticipating
              hospitals, based on program participation status in 2011. A
              difference-in-differences analytic approach was used to evaluate
              whether hospital participation in the ACS TQIP or the MTQIP was
              associated with improved outcomes compared with nonparticipation
              in a quality improvement program. EXPOSURES: Hospital
              participation in MTQIP, a quality improvement collaborative,
              compared with ACS TQIP participation and nonparticipating
              hospitals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In-hospital mortality,
              mortality or hospice, major complications, and venous
              thromboembolism events were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 2 373 130
              included trauma patients, 64.2\% were men and 73.0\% were white,
              and the mean (SD) age was 50.7 (21.9) years. After accounting for
              patient factors and preexisting time trends toward improved
              outcomes, there was a statistically significant improvement in
              major complications after (vs before) hospital enrollment in the
              MTQIP collaborative compared with nonparticipating hospitals
              (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.83-0.95) or ACS TQIP hospitals
              (OR, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.82-0.94). A similar result was observed for
              venous thromboembolism (MTQIP vs nonparticipating: OR, 0.78; 95\%
              CI, 0.69-0.88; MTQIP vs ACS TQIP: OR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.74-0.95),
              for which MTQIP targeted specific performance improvement
              efforts. Hospital participation in both ACS TQIP and MTQIP was
              associated with improvement in mortality or hospice (ACS TQIP vs
              nonparticipating: OR, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.93; MTQIP vs
              nonparticipating: OR, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.96). Hospitals
              participating in MTQIP achieved the lowest overall risk-adjusted
              mortality in the postenrollment period (4.2\%; 95\% CI, 4.1-4.3).
              CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates that hospital
              participation in a regional collaborative quality improvement
              program is associated with improved patient outcomes beyond
              benchmark reporting alone while promoting compliance with

              of addressing the problems with healthcare, evidence of its
              effectiveness has remained very mixed. The reasons for this are
              varied but the growing literature highlights particular
              challenges. Fidelity in the application of QI methods is often
              variable. QI work is often pursued through time-limited,
              small-scale projects, led by professionals who may lack the
              expertise, power or resources to instigate the changes required.
              There is insufficient attention to rigorous evaluation of
              improvement and to sharing the lessons of successes and failures.
              Too many QI interventions are seen as 'magic bullets' that will
              produce improvement in any situation, regardless of context. Too
              much improvement work is undertaken in isolation at a local level,
              failing to pool resources and develop collective solutions, and
              introducing new hazards in the process. This article considers
              these challenges and proposes four key ways in which QI might
              itself be improved.",

              been seriously underrecognised. We join others in proposing that
              more informed use of theory can strengthen improvement programmes
              and facilitate the evaluation of their effectiveness. Many
              professionals, including improvement practitioners, are
              unfortunately mystified-and alienated-by theory, which discourages
              them from using it in their work. In an effort to demystify theory
              we make the point in this paper that, far from being discretionary
              or superfluous, theory ('reason-giving'), both informal and
              formal, is intimately woven into virtually all human endeavour. We
              explore the special characteristics of grand, mid-range and
              programme theory; consider the consequences of misusing theory or
              failing to use it; review the process of developing and applying
              programme theory; examine some emerging criteria of 'good' theory;
              and emphasise the value, as well as the challenge, of combining
              informal experience-based theory with formal, publicly developed
              theory. We conclude that although informal theory is always at
              work in improvement, practitioners are often not aware of it or do
              not make it explicit. The germane issue for improvement
              practitioners, therefore, is not whether they use theory but
              whether they make explicit the particular theory or theories,
              informal and formal, they actually use.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Several types of audits have been used to promote
               quality improvement (QI) in hospital care. However, in-depth
               studies into the mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of
               audits in a given context is scarce. We sought to understand the
               mechanisms and contextual factors that determine why audits
               might, or might not, lead to improved quality of hospital care.
               METHODS: A realist review was conducted to systematically search
               and synthesise the literature on audits. Data from individual
               papers were synthesised by coding, iteratively testing and
               supplementing initial programme theories, and refining these
               theories into a set of context-mechanism-outcome configurations
               (CMOcs). RESULTS: From our synthesis of 85 papers, seven CMOcs
               were identified that explain how audits work: (1) externally
               initiated audits create QI awareness although their impact on
               improvement diminishes over time; (2) a sense of urgency felt by
               healthcare professionals triggers engagement with an audit; (3)
               champions are vital for an audit to be perceived by healthcare
               professionals as worth the effort; (4) bottom-up initiated audits
               are more likely to bring about sustained change; (5)
               knowledge-sharing within externally mandated audits triggers
               participation by healthcare professionals; (6) audit data support
               healthcare professionals in raising issues in their dialogues
               with those in leadership positions; and (7) audits legitimise the
               provision of feedback to colleagues, which flattens the perceived
               hierarchy and encourages constructive collaboration. CONCLUSIONS:
               This realist review has identified seven CMOcs that should be
               taken into account when seeking to optimise the design and usage
               of audits. These CMOcs can provide policy makers and practice
               leaders with an adequate conceptual grounding to design
               contextually sensitive audits in diverse settings and advance the
               audit research agenda for various contexts. PROSPERO
